Failure to pay fines.\n(1) The failure of any Responsible Party to pay the fines assessed by an administrative citation within the time specified on\nthe citation or administrative enforcement order, if an administrative hearing was held, may result in the imposition of a\nlate fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), a twenty percent (20%) charge to defray the cost of collection, and interest at a rate of ten\npercent (10%) per annum on all unpaid amounts.\n(2) In the event of failure to pay all fines assessed, the City Manager may refer the matter for collection by whatever means\nare available to the City.\n(3) As authorized by C.R.S. \u00a7 31-20-105, the City may certify all delinquent charges and assessments made under this\nArticle to the treasurer of the County to be collected and paid over by the Treasurer of the County in the same manner as\ntaxes are collected.\n(4)\u00a0 An action or other process provided by law may be maintained by the City to recover or collect any amounts, including\nlate fees, interests, and administrative costs, owing under this Article.\n", "Chapter 6 - [Title from PDF Content]": "Chapter 6 - Elections\nSections :\n6-1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Nominating petition requirements; qualifications of candidates; conduct of elections.\n6-2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Vacancies in Council or Office of Mayor.\n6-3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Write-in candidate affidavit.\nCHAPTER 6. \u00a0ELECTIONS.\nSection 6-1.
