If any permittee fails to sustain, secure or protect\nsuch pipes, poles, mains, cables, utilities or conduits from injury or to replace and compact the earth under or around\nthem, as the provisions of this section require, then the same may be done by the entity to whom the same may belong and\nthe cost thereof and all damages sustained by such entity thereby shall be paid by such permittee and in default thereof,\nsuch entity may maintain an action against him therefor.\n(6) Excavation backfill. The permittee shall backfill the excavation in accordance with one of the two following\nmethodologies as set forth below:\n(a) METHOD A\n(I) \u00a0Backfill below the top two (2) feet shall be compacted to 90% of its maximum Modified Proctor density\n(ASTM D 1557). Backfill material shall be clean dry material free from muck, frozen lumps, vegetative matter or\nrubbish. All fill shall be placed in uniform and relatively level layers not to exceed eight inches prior to\ncompaction.\n(II) \u00a0The top two (2) feet shall be backfilled with well graded aggregate with a maximum size of one inch\nmaterial and shall be compacted to 95% of its maximum Modified Proctor density (ASTM D 1557). The fill shall\nbe placed and compacted at a moisture content within + 2% of its optimum moisture. All fill shall be placed in\nuniform and relatively level layers not to exceed eight inches prior to compaction.\n(III) \u00a0The City may perform compaction density tests on any excavation. \u00a0Any backfill not meeting the\ncompaction requirements will be removed by the permittee and recompacted as necessary to meet the\nrequirements.\n(b) METHOD B\n(I) \u00a0Backfilling shall be accomplished via the use of flowable fill. Flowable fill is a self-leveling flowable, lean\nconcrete mix which can be placed in one or more lifts with no tamping required. The 28 day compressive\nstrength shall be less than 60 psi to ensure the backfill can be easily re-excavated to facilitate future repairs, but\nshall be greater than 40 psi to ensure stability of the trench.\n(II) \u00a0The flowable fill mix design shall be as determined by the City of Trinidad Engineering Department based\nupon the availability of materials and shall consist of water, portland cement, fine and coarse aggregates.\nFlowable fill shall be mixed in accordance with ASTM Standard Specifications for Ready Mix Concrete. The\nflowable fill shall be thoroughly mixed prior to discharging to ensure a uniform product and shall be discharged\nas close as practical to its final location to reduce segregation. Use of a spud vibrator is recommended to\nimprove the consolidation of the flowable fill mix.\n(III) \u00a0Use of flowable fill eliminates the need for any compaction of the\nbackfill. The maximum layer thickness shall be four feet.

Such assessment shall constitute a perpetual, first and prior lien on the property\ninvolved. The City Manager or his/her designee shall certify to the County Treasurer the assessments which are not paid\nwithin twenty (20) days of the date of assessment. Ten percent (10%) of the amount shall be added to the assessment to\npay the cost of collection.\n(8) If a hearing is requested pursuant to this Section, the City Manager or his/her designee shall conduct a hearing as soon\nas practicable, at which time testimony and evidence may be presented relative to the propriety of impounding such\nvehicle and/or recreational vehicle, and the City Manager or his/her designee shall issue a decision following the hearing\nas to whether the owner or other person in charge of or in control of any private property, or the owner of any vehicle\nand/or recreational vehicle has permitted or allowed such wrecked, junked or partially dismantled vehicle and/or\nrecreational vehicle or parts thereof to remain on private property longer that thirty (30) days pursuant to this Section,\nand whether such vehicle and/or recreational vehicle or parts thereof, is subject to impoundment.
