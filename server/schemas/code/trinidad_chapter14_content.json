Specific conditional uses for each zone district are listed in the Table 14-42 \nUse Table. \nB. Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Review Process. All applications for conditional uses will be reviewed \naccording to the procedures set forth in Section 14-27 Limited Impact Review Procedures. \nAdministrative conditional uses will be reviewed according to procedures set forth in 14-25 \nAdministrative Review Procedures. \nC. Expiration of Conditional Use Permit. \n1. Conditional use permit approval shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of approval \nor within a longer period determined by the Administrator or Planning Zoning, and \nVariance Commission, as applicable, for uses which involve phasing, but in no event \nlonger than three (3) years from the date of approval. The conditional use approval may \ncontain conditions as deemed appropriate by the Administrator or Planning Zoning, and \nVariance Commission in approving the permit. Within the one-year period, or other \napproved period, the permit holder must either begin construction or establish the land \nuse authorized by the conditional use permit, including any conditions attached to the \nconditional use approval. The permit holder must continue to operate the land use or \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-43.

Failure to \nstart construction, establish, or operate such use within the one-year or other applicable \ntime period shall result in automatic expiration of the conditional use permit. Once a \nconditional use is established, any discontinuance of the use for a period of one (1) year, \nfor any reason, shall result in automatic expiration of the conditional use permit, unless \notherwise provided in the permit.  The approval of a conditional use may or may not \nidentify an initial term for the conditional use as determined by the Planning Zoning, \nand Variance Commission.  A conditional use may be brought back to the Planning \nZoning, and Variance Commission if there are neighborhood, expiration of land use, or \nviolations of City codes or conditions. Upon expiration of the term, if the permit is so \nlimited, the conditional use permit shall automatically expire.   \n2. Prior to expiration of the initial term or an extended term, the applicant may submit a \nrequest to the Administrator to extend the conditional use approval, which request shall \nspecify the reasons why the use should be permitted to continue. The approval shall be \ndeemed extended until the Administrator or Planning Commission, as applicable, has \nacted upon the request for extension. The City shall be authorized to deny an extension \nor extend the approval and to impose additional conditions, if necessary. \nD. Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Application Review Criteria. A conditional use permit application is \nsubject to the following approval criteria. It is the applicant\u2019s burden to demonstrate, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that each of the following criteria is satisfied by the application: \n1. The conditional use will satisfy all applicable provisions of the Code. \n2. The conditional use will conform with or further the goals and strategies set forth in the \nComprehensive Plan. \n3. The conditional use will be adequately served with public utilities, services, and facilities (i.e. \nwater, wastewater, electric, gas, schools, street system, fire protection, public transit, storm \ndrainage, solid waste collection, parks system, etc.) and not impose an undue burden above \nand beyond those of the permitted uses of the district. \n4. The conditional use will not substantially alter the basic character of the district. \n5. The conditional use will result in efficient on- and off-site traffic circulation which will not \nhave a significant adverse impact on the adjacent uses or result in hazardous conditions for \npedestrians or vehicles in or adjacent to the site. \n6. All applicable permits and approvals from other agencies, entities or jurisdictions have been \nor will be obtained. \n7. Potential negative impacts of the conditional use on the rest of the neighborhood or of the \nneighborhood on the conditional use have been mitigated through setbacks, architecture, \nscreen walls, landscaping, site arrangement or other methods. The application shall address \nthe following potential negative impacts, at a minimum: \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-44.

ZONING \nSection 14-46. Amendments \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n79 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nB. Procedure. \nThere is no separate procedure for an Administrative Adjustment. Instead, applicants under Site \nPlans or Subdivision applications may include a request for an Administrative Adjustment with those \napplications. \nC. Criteria for Approval. \n1. The adjustment allows improved site or building design elements to be incorporated that \nare more consistent with the surrounding context; and \n2. The adjustment will impact permitted development standards on no more than two \nadjacent lots; and \n3. The adjustment addresses an unusual site constraint or unusual requirement of the \nproposed use or building that is not common to other lots, uses, or buildings in the \nsurrounding area; and \n4. The adjustment will have no material adverse impact on any abutting lot, or any material \nadverse impacts have been mitigated by conditions attached to the adjustment; and \n5. The adjustment does not violate any conditions of approval specifically applied to \ndevelopment of the property by the Planning, Zoning, and Variance Commission or City \nCouncil. \n6. For an adjustment to the maximum number or area of signs or sign setbacks, the adjustment will \nhave a minimal visual effect on the surrounding neighborhood and is necessary to compensate \nfor unusual shape or orientation of the lot or to allow sign visibility comparable to, but not \nexceeding, that available to nearby lots of approximately the same size and shape in the same \nzone district. \nSection 14-46. AMENDMENTS \nA. Authority. Amendments to the Zoning Map shall be in accordance with the statutes of the State of \nColorado, with recommendation from the Commission to the City Council prior to the adoption of \nany such amendment.

For the purposes of establishing and maintaining sound, stable and desirable development \nwithin the City of Trinidad, the rezoning of land is to be discouraged and allowed only under \ncertain circumstances as provided hereafter. This policy is based on the opinion of the City \nCouncil that the City's zoning map is the result of a detailed and comprehensive appraisal of \nthe City's present and future needs regarding land use allocation and, as such, should not be \namended unless to correct a manifest error or because of changed or changing conditions in \na particular area or the City in general. \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-46. Amendments \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n80 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n2. Rezoning shall only be approved if the applicant demonstrates by a preponderance of the \nevidence that rezoning is necessary for one or more of the following reasons: \na. There was an error in establishing the current zoning. \nb. The area for which rezoning is requested has changed or is changing to such a \ndegree that it is in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or a \nnew approach to development; or \nc. The proposed rezoning is necessary in order to provide land for a community related \nuse which was not contemplated at the time of development of the comprehensive \nplan. \n3. In addition, no rezoning shall be approved unless the applicant demonstrates by a \npreponderance of the evidence that each of the following criteria are met: \na. That a change in zoning will advance a more effective use of land in harmony with the City\u2019s \ncomprehensive plan; \nb. The intensity of development in the new zoning district is not expected to create \nsignificantly adverse impacts to surrounding properties or the neighborhood; and \nc. Public facilities and services are available to adequately serve the subject property while \nmaintaining an adequate level of service to existing development. \n4. These standards do not apply to a legislative rezoning of the City\u2019s zoning map. \nC. Procedure for Amendments in General. \n1. Amendments to Zoning Regulations. The City Council may, from time to time, on its own \nmotion, on petition of an interested person, or by the recommendation of the Commission, \namend, supplement or repeal the regulations and provisions of this Article, following the \nprocedure (at least one public hearing) required by the Colorado Revised Statutes. \nD.

General Community Design \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n108 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-58. GENERAL COMMUNITY DESIGN \nA. Intent. The future character and environment of the City will be greatly affected by the design of \nsubdivisions and developments that are approved by the City. Planning, layout and design of \nsubdivisions, development and redevelopment of existing parcels are of utmost concern. The intent \nof the community design standards is to create a vital, cohesive, well-designed community in order \nto enhance Trinidad\u2019s unique character and further the citizens\u2019 goals as identified in the Trinidad \nComprehensive Plan. \nB. Community Design Elements. \n1. Compact Urban Growth. As the community grows from the original City limits, it is \nimportant to maintain a continuity of density, diversity and interconnectedness. Urban \ndevelopment should occur adjacent to the City\u2019s core so that the community\u2019s rural land and \nnatural areas are preserved and public infrastructure and utilities are used as efficiently as \npossible. \n2. Neighborhood Design. Residents must have available to them within their neighborhoods, \nsafe and convenient access and movement to points of destination or collection. Modes of \ntravel to achieve this objective should be varied and should not conflict with each other or \nabutting land uses. Lots and blocks should provide desirable settings for the buildings that \nare to be constructed, make use of natural contours, protect views, and provide privacy of \nresidents and protection from adverse noise, lighting and vehicular traffic. Natural features \nand vegetation of the area should be preserved. Schools, parks, churches and other \ncommunity facilities should be planned as integral parts of neighborhoods. \n3. Community Connectivity. All portions of a tract being subdivided, unless otherwise \npermitted, shall be designed as lots, streets, planned open spaces, or other uses to avoid \ncreation of vacant landlocked spaces. The design of subdivisions shall provide for efficient \ntraffic flow, proper mixing of land uses, and a logical link between nearby existing \ndevelopments and the proposed subdivision. The City's Comprehensive Plan is to be used as \na guide in determining if the design of a proposed subdivision is proper. A plat may be \ndenied or required to be redesign, if, in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and any \nother adopted plans or policies, the proposed layout is not suitable for the site, or if the \ndevelopment of the subdivision would be premature. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-58. General Community Design \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n109 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n4. Environment. New developments should be designed to fit within the environment by ensuring \nthe following: \na. Subdivisions and land developments shall be designed to prevent excessive erosion by the \nforces of wind and/or water, and shall be laid out so as to avoid the necessity for excessive \ncut and fill. \nb. Whenever possible, developers shall preserve trees and other vegetation, waterways \nsuch as creeks and arroyos, viewsheds and scenic points, cultural and historic sites and \nresources, and other local assets and landmarks. \nc. Where feasible, conservation of energy through the use of solar and wind systems in \naccordance with federal guidelines is encouraged. \nd. Drainage areas, whenever possible, should be left in a natural state and no \nencroachments shall be made on the natural channel area. Drainage designs of \nsubdivisions shall be engineered using accepted best management practices, and so as \nto not increase historic drainage patterns or flows off site. \ne. Any land subject to flooding shall be platted in accordance with any applicable \nfloodplain ordinances, statutes and/or laws. The following should be indicated as a plat \nnote, where applicable: \"Homebuilders are required to provide a floodplain elevation \ncertificate prior to or with a building permit application. All plans and specs are required \nto meet FEMA guidelines for flood mitigation.\" Land subject to flooding or other hazards \nto life, health, or property, and land deemed to be unsuitable from the standpoint of \ngeology, soil conditions, or topography, shall not be platted for residential occupancy or \nother such purposes as may increase danger to health, life, or property, and shall not \naggravate erosion or flood hazard, unless such hazards are properly mitigated through \nthe subdivision planning process as provided in this Article. \nf. \nWhere a subdivision borders a railroad right-of-way or principal arterial street, design of \nthe subdivision shall include adequate provisions for the reduction of noise. \n5. Except as provided herein, all developments shall have frontage on and direct access to a \npublic right-of-way. In the interest of public safety and for the preservation of the traffic-\ncarrying capacity of the street system, the City Council shall have the right to restrict and \nregulate points of access to all property from the public street system. \nARTICLE 6.

In general, blocks should not be less than 300 \nfeet in length. \nb. Blocks should not be designed so as to provide two (2) tiers of lots. \nc. Blocks may be irregular in shape, provided they are harmonious with the overall patter \nof blocks in a proposed subdivision. \nd. Blocks shall not be designed with dead end streets. \nE. Additional Area Regulations. The following additional area regulations shall apply to all zone \ndistricts: \n1. For the purpose of the side yard regulations, a two-family dwelling or a multiple dwelling \nshall be considered as one (1) building occupying one lot unless developed as a Planned Unit \nDevelopment. \n2. An open unenclosed porch or paved terrace may project into a front yard for a distance not \nexceeding ten feet (10'). An unenclosed vestibule containing not more than forty (40) square \nfeet may project into a front yard for a distance not to exceed four feet (4'). \n3. Open-lattice enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, and balconies opening upon \nfire towers, and the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues into the rear yard may be \npermitted for a distance of not more than three and one-half feet (3 \u00bd') and where the same \nare so placed as not to obstruct light and ventilation. \n4. Terraces, uncovered porches, platforms and ornamental features which do not extend more \nthan three feet (3') above the floor level of the ground story may project into a required \nyard provided these projections be at least two feet (2') from the adjacent side lot line. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n112 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nSection 14-60. STREET AND CONNECTIVITY STANDARDS \nA. Intent. The intent of the street and connectivity standards is to establish a safe, efficient, and \nattractive transportation system that promotes all modes of transportation and is sensitive to the \nenvironment. \nB. General Provisions. The street system of any proposed development shall be designed to create \nblocks that consider interconnectedness, topography, solar orientation, views, and consider the use \nby all modes of transportation that will use the system. Streets should be an inviting public space \nand an integral part of community design. Local streets shall provide for both intra- and inter-\nneighborhood connections to knit developments together, rather than forming barriers between \nthem. All streets should interconnect to help create a comprehensive network of public areas to \nserve all modes of transportation (including, but not limited to cars, trucks, buses, bicycles, \npedestrians, etc.). \n1. Street System Pattern. The street system pattern proposed in any development must \ncomply with the provisions of the Article and other applicable provisions of the City\u2019s Code \nof Ordinances, and shall: \na. Be designed to be logically related to topography so as to produce reasonable grades, \nsatisfactory drainage, suitable building sites, and provide for horizontal sight distances on all \ncurves depending on design speed. \nb. Provide for adequate vehicular access to all properties within the proposed subdivision \nplat boundaries. \nc. Provide adequate street connections to adjacent properties to ensure adequate traffic \ncirculation within the general area. \nd. Provide a local street system serving properties to be developed for residential purposes \nwhich discourages through traffic while maintaining sufficient access and traffic \nmovement for convenient circulation within the subdivision and access by fire, police \nand other emergency services. \ne. Provide a sufficient number of continuous streets and major thoroughfares, particularly \nin those areas designated for the development of high density multiple-family \nresidential, commercial and industrial land uses, to accommodate the increased traffic \ndemands generated by these land uses. \nf. \nWhen necessary to the neighborhood pattern, existing streets in adjoining areas shall be \ncontinued and shall be at least as wide as such existing streets in alignment therewith. \nWhen conditions permit, centerline offsets should be at least 125 feet. Greater \ncenterline offsets may be required by the City when necessary for traffic safety. Where a \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n113 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nproposed subdivision is adjacent to or at the end of an existing street which will afford \nprimary or significant access to the proposed subdivision and is determined by the City \nEngineer, in accordance with traffic engineering principles and practice, to be of \ninadequate design or construction, the developer will be required to improve, \nreconstruct, widen or make any other alterations to the existing street as deemed \nnecessary by the City in order to provide appropriate and safe access to the subdivision. \ng. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the City may require the arrangement of \nstreets in the subdivision to make provision for the proper projection of streets into \nsuch unsubdivided areas. \nh. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practical giving due regard to \nterrain, topography, sight distances and safety. \n2. Cul-de-sacs, Dead-End Streets and Stub Streets. \na. Length of cul-de-sac. The length of all cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 500 feet, unless \ntopographic conditions warrant a longer length. \nb. Radius of cul-de-sac. The radius of the right-of-way for all cul-de-sacs shall not be less \nthan sixty (60) feet. \nc. Drainage of a cul-de-sac. Drainage of a cul-de-sac shall preferably be toward the open \nend. \nd. Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs, to permit future \nextensions into adjoining tracts or when designed as circular cul-de-sac turnarounds. \ne. Stub streets. Stub streets, greater in length than one (1) lot length, shall be paved to the \nfull width of the right-of-way for the last fifty (50) feet of their length. \n3. Street Connections. All streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets consistent \nwith the Transportation & Connectivity Plan of the Trinidad Comprehensive Plan. All streets shall \nbe designed to be logically related to topography so as to produce reasonable grades, \nsatisfactory drainage, suitable building sites, and provide for horizontal sight distances on all \ncurves depending on design speed. Street and transportation system shall provide more than \none direct connection to and between local destinations such as schools, trails, parks, historic \nand cultural resources, and Trinidad\u2019s nexus of Scenic Byways. Streets must provide connections \nwithin subdivisions and to adjoining properties to blend developments together and to disperse \ntraffic. \n4. Street Paving and Design. All streets shall be paved and shall be designed and constructed in \naccordance with City Engineering Design and Specifications Manual. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60.

All subdivision plats shall include a local street \nsystem that will allow access to and from the proposed subdivision, as well as access to all \nexisting and future adjacent development from at least two streets. A sufficient number of \ncontinuous streets and major thoroughfares shall be provided, particularly in those areas \ndesignated for the development of high density multiple-family residential, commercial and \nindustrial land uses, to accommodate the increased traffic demands generated by these land \nuses. \n6. Utilization and Provision of Local Street Connections To and From Adjacent Developments and \nVacant Parcels. All subdivisions shall incorporate and continue all streets stubbed to the \nboundary of the property by previously approved plats or existing development or as \ndetermined by the City Engineer. Existing streets in adjoining areas shall be continued and shall \nbe at least as wide as such existing streets in alignment therewith. When conditions permit, \ncenterline offsets should be at least 125 feet. Greater centerline offsets may be required by the \nCity when necessary for traffic safety. Where a proposed subdivision is adjacent to or at the end \nof an existing street which will afford primary or significant access to the proposed subdivision \nand is determined by the City Engineer, in accordance with traffic engineering principles and \npractice, to be of inadequate design or construction, the developer will be required to improve, \nreconstruct, widen or make any other alterations to the existing street as deemed necessary by \nthe City in order to provide appropriate and safe access to the subdivision at the developer\u2019s \nexpense. \n7. Street Intersections. Intersections of streets shall be as nearly at right angles as practical \ngiving due regard to terrain, topography, sight distance and safety. \n8. Street Layout. The street layout shall form an interconnected system of streets primarily in a \ngrid or modified pattern adapted to the topography, unique natural features, environmental \nconstraints, and open space areas. The street layout shall emphasize the location of \nneighborhood focus points, other internal open space areas, gateways, and vistas. The use \nof cul-de-sacs and other roadways with a single point of access shall be minimized. \n9. Buffering and Traffic Separation Requirements for Streets. Where a subdivision abuts or \ncontains an existing or proposed street, the City may require marginal access streets, \nreverse frontage with screening by landscaping and berming contained in a nonaccess \nreservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other \ntreatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to \nafford a separation of through and local traffic. If landscaping or berming is used as a buffer \nbetween the street and residential property uses, the subdivider shall provide a minimum \n20-foot landscape buffer in an easement or in a tract dedicated for such purposes along the \nstreet. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n115 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n10. Visibility at Intersections. No plantings, signs, berms, fences, walls, structures, or other \nmaterials or items greater than thirty (30) inches in height shall be planted, created or \nmaintained at street intersections within the sight distance triangle.  \n11. Access. Access to all subdivisions shall be from a public street system or an approved private \nstreet. Driveways shall not be permitted to have direct access to arterials or state highways \n(principal arterials). \n12. Right-of-Way Width. The width of the right-of-way to be dedicated for any designated street \nshall be in conformance with the City's Transportation & Connectivity Plan, and meet the \nminimum specifications of the Engineering Design and Specifications Manual or as \ndetermined and approved by the City Engineer. In those instances where the proposed \nsubdivision is located contiguous to an existing street having a right-of-way less than that \nrequired by the Engineering Design and Specifications Manual, sufficient additional right-of-\nway must be dedicated to bring the right-of-way width in conformance with the Engineering \nDesign and Specifications Manual. In all cases the minimum right-of-way width required for \nthe development of a designated street must be of sufficient width to accommodate the \napproved roadway pavement and drainage and utility facilities. \n13. Street Right-of-Way Dedication. The full width of right-of-way for all streets being platted \nmust be dedicated to the City. Partial or half streets may be dedicated, subject to the \nprovisions of this Section. \n14. Private Streets. Private streets may be permitted by the City Council if it determines that the \nuse of private streets will preserve the aesthetic environmental qualities of the subdivision \nwhile providing property owners with a safe, functional and lasting means of access. The \ndesign and approval of any private streets shall promote driver and pedestrian safety by \nimproving movement along streets and ingress and egress for properties adjacent thereto. \nGenerally, as the widths of streets and vehicular speeds increase, the number of private \nstreet connections thereto should decrease. \n15. Private Street Design. Private streets shall be designed in accordance with traffic engineering \nprinciples and practices as applied to existing and anticipated conditions, particularly the \nland uses to be served and the configuration of the street itself. Private streets shall meet all \nrequirements contained in this Article for public streets. Adequate space shall be provided in \nthe private street right-of-way for easements for the location and maintenance of utilities.

PROTECTION OF FLOOD PLAINS \nSection 14-100. \nSTATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE \nAND OBJECTIVES \nA. Statutory Authorization. \nThe Legislature of the State of Colorado has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to \nadopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. \nTherefore, the City Council of Trinidad, Colorado does ordain as follows: \nB. Findings of Fact. \n1. The flood hazard areas of Trinidad are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of \nlife and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental \nservices, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment \nof tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. \n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special \nflood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, \ndamage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or \notherwise protected from damage also contribute to the flood loss. \nC. Statement of Purpose \nIt is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to \nminimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed: \n1. To protect human life and health; \n2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; \n3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally \nundertaken at the expense of the general public; \n4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions; \n5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, \ntelephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; \n6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas \nof special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; \nARTICLE 9. PROTECTION OF FLOOD PLAINS \nSection 14-101. Definitions \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n187 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n7. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood \nhazard; and \n8. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for \ntheir actions. \nD. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses \nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for: \n1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to \nwater or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood \nheights or velocities; \n2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be \nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; \n3. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective \nbarriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; \n4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood \ndamage; and, \n5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood \nwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. \nSection 14-101. \nDEFINITIONS \nUnless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give \nthem the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable \napplication. \n100-Year Flood - A flood having a recurrence interval that has a one-percent chance of being equaled or \nexceeded during any given year (1-percent-annual-chance flood).

Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, \ndesignated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities, and \ntransportation lifelines. \nThese facilities consist of: \na. Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment \nstorage, and, emergency operation centers); \nb. Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having \nemergency treatment functions, and non-ambulatory surgical structures but excluding \nclinics, doctors offices, and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide \nthese functions); \nc. Designated emergency shelters; \nd. Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, \nsatellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio, and other emergency warning \nsystems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables, and conduits); \ne. Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, \nsubstations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, \npoles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines, and service \nlines); and \nf. \nAir Transportation lifelines (airports (municipal and larger), helicopter pads and \nstructures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure (aviation control \ntowers, air traffic control centers, and emergency equipment aircraft hangars). \nSpecific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), non-potable \nwater treatment and distribution systems, and hydroelectric power generating plants and \nrelated appurtenances. \nPublic utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the \nTrinidad City Council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will \nnot be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant \nfacilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an \nintergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are \neither located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this \nArticle, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide \nservice to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be \nprovided to the Trinidad City Council on an as-needed basis upon request. \nARTICLE 9. PROTECTION OF FLOOD PLAINS \nSection 14-107.

The TPQ for these chemicals is: either 500 pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever \nis lower) for the 356 chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 302 (2010), also known as Extremely \nHazardous Substances (EHS); or 10,000 pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is \nconsistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado \nDepartment of Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for SDS can be found in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation \u201cDesignation, Reportable \nQuantities, and Notification,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 302 (2010) and OSHA regulation \u201cOccupational Safety \nand Health Standards,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include \nthe regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation this ordinance, but exclude later \namendments to or editions of the regulations \nSpecific exemptions to this category include: \na. Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous \nmaterials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural \nuse. \nb. Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be \ndemonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard \nassessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local \njurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material \ndoes not pose a major threat to the public. \nc. Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture \npharmaceutical products. \nThese exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as Critical \nFacilities under another category outlined in this Article. \nARTICLE 9.

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. \nWIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES  \nA. Purpose, Intent and Goals. The purpose and intent of these provisions is to establish requirements \nfor the siting of Wireless Communications Facilities. The goals of these provisions are to: \n1. Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance, modification, and removal \nof wireless communications infrastructure in the City with the fewest number of WCFs to \ncomplete a network without unreasonably discriminating against wireless communications \nproviders of functionally equivalent services including all of those who install, maintain, operate, \nand remove WCFs \n2. Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing the visibility of WCFs to \nthe fullest extent possible through techniques including but not limited to camouflage design \ntechniques and undergrounding of WCFs and the equipment associated therewith.  \n3. Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive WCFs to supplement existing larger WCFs  \n4. Encourage the use of wall mounted panel antennas.  \n5. Encourage roof mounted antennas only when wall mounted antennas will not provide adequate \nservice or are not otherwise feasible.  \n6. Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas, in a manner that minimizes the total \nnumber of towers needed throughout the community.  \n7. Encourage strongly the collocation of WCFs on new and existing sites.  \n8. Encourage owners and users of antennas and towers to locate them, to the extent possible, in \nareas where the adverse impact on the community is minimized.  \n9. Enhance the ability of wireless communications service providers to provide such services to the \ncommunity quickly, effectively, and efficiently.  \n10. Effectively manage WCFs in the public Right-of-Way.  \n11. Manage Amateur Radio Facilities and Over-the-Air Receiving Devices in the City.  \nB. Applicability. \nThe requirements set forth in this Section shall apply to all WCF applications for Base Stations, \nAlternative Tower Structures, Alternative Tower Structures located within Right-of-Way and Towers, \nas defined in Section this Article and as further addressed herein. The requirements set forth in this \nSection shall not apply to:  \n1. Amateur radio antennas that are owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio \nstation operator or are used exclusively for receive-only antennas, provided that the \nrequirement that the height be no more than the distance from the base of the antenna to the \nproperty line is met.  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n242 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n2. Pre-existing WCFs. Any WCF for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective \ndate of this Section shall not be required to meet the requirements hereof other than the \noperational standards of Subsection C below.  Changes and additions to pre-existing WCFs \n(including trading out of antennas for an equal number of antennas) shall meet applicable \nrequirements of this Section. \n3. Miscellaneous Antennas. Antennas used for reception of television, multi-channel video \nprogramming and radio such as OTARD antennas, television broadcast band antennas, and \nbroadcast radio antennas, provided that any requirements related to Accessory Uses contained \nin this Chapter and the requirement that the height be no more than the distance from the base \nto the property line are met. The City Manager has the authority to approve modifications to \nthe height restriction related to OTARD antennas and OTARD antenna structures, if in the \nreasonable discretion of the City, modifications are necessary to comply with federal law.  \nC. Operational Standards.  \n1. Federal Requirements. All WCFs shall meet the current standards and regulations of the FAA, \nthe FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate WCFs. If \nsuch standards and regulations are changes, then the owners of the WCF governed by this \nSection shall bring such facility into compliance with such revised standards and regulations \nwithin the time period mandated by the controlling federal agency.  \n2. No Signal Interference with Public Safety. All WCFs shall be designed and sited so as not to \ncause interference with any public safety communications. The Applicant shall provide a written \nstatement from a qualified radio frequency engineer, certifying that a technical evaluation of \nexisting and proposed facilities indicates no potential interference problems and shall allow the \nCity to monitor interference levels with public safety communications during this process. \nAdditionally, the Applicant shall notify the City at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the \nintroduction of new service or changes in existing service and shall allow the City to monitor \ninterference levels with public safety communications during the testing process.  \n3. Legal Access. In all Applications for WCFs an Applicant must warrant and represent that it has \nthe written agreement of the owner of the property which is the subject of the application for \nlegal access to and from the WCF and the Applicant must also warrant and represent that it will \nhave legal access to the utilities to operate and maintain the WCF.  \n4. Operation and Maintenance. To ensure the structural integrity of WCFs, the owner of a WCF \nshall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local \nbuilding and safety codes. If upon inspection, the City concludes that a WCF fails to comply with \nsuch codes and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon written notice being \nprovided to the owner of the WCF, the owner shall have thirty (30) days from the date of notice \nto bring such WCF into compliance. Upon good cause shown by the owner, the City's Chief \nBuilding Official may extend such compliance period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the \ndate of said notice. If the owner fails to bring such WCF into compliance within said time period, \nthe City may remove such WCF at the owner's expense.  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n243 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n5. Abandonment and Removal. If a WCF has not been in use for a period of three (3) months, the \nowner of the WCF shall notify the City of the non-use and shall indicate whether re-use is \nexpected within the ensuing three (3) months. Any WCF that is not operated for a continuous \nperiod of six (6) months shall be considered abandoned. The City Manager, in his or her sole \ndiscretion, may require an abandoned WCF to be removed. The owner of such WCF shall \nremove the same within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice form the City. If such WCF is \nnot removed within said thirty (30) days, the City may remove it at the owner's expense and any \napproved permits for the WCF shall be deemed to have expired.  \nD. Design Standards. The requirements set forth in this Section shall apply to the location and design \nof all WCFs governed by this Section as specified below; provided, however, that the City Manager \nmay waive these requirements it he or she determines that the goals of this Section are better \nserved thereby. To that end, WCFs shall be designed and located to minimize the impact on the \nsurrounding neighborhood and to maintain the character and appearance of the City, consistent \nwith other provisions of this Code. \n1. Camouflage/Concealment. All WCFs and any Transmission Equipment shall, to the extent \npossible, use camouflage design techniques including, but not limited to the use of materials, \ncolors, textures, screening, undergrounding, landscaping, or other design options that will blend \nthe WCF to the surrounding natural setting and built environment. Design, materials and colors \nof WCFs shall be compatible with the surrounding environment. Designs shall be compatible \nwith structures and vegetation on the same parcel and adjacent parcels. \na. Camouflage design may be of heightened importance where findings of particular sensitivity \nare made (e.g. proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views, and/or \ncommunity features). In such instances where WCFs are located in areas of high visibility, \nthey shall (where possible) be designed (e.g., placed underground, depressed, or located \nbehind earth berms) to minimize their profile.  \nb. The camouflage design may include the use of Alternative Tower Structures should the City \ndetermine that such design meets the intent of this Code and the community is better \nserved thereby.  \nc. All WCFs, such as antennas, vaults, equipment rooms, equipment enclosures, and tower \nstructures shall be constructed out of non-reflective materials (visible exterior surfaces \nonly).  \n2. Hazardous Materials. No hazardous materials shall be permitted in association with WCFs, \nexcept those necessary for the operations of the WCF and only in accordance with all applicable \nlaws governing such materials. \n3. Siting. \na. No portion of any WCF may extend beyond the property line.  \nb. Collocation. WCFs may be required to be designed and constructed to permit the facility to \naccommodate WCFs from at least two (2) wireless service providers on the same WCF \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n244 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nunless the City approves an alternative design. No WCF owner or operator shall unfairly \nexclude a competitor from using the same facility or location.  \nc. WCFs shall be sited in a location that does not reduce the parking for the other principal \nuses on the parcel below Code standards.  \n4. Lighting.  WCFs shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable \ngovernmental authority, or the WCF is mounted on a light pole or other similar structure \nprimarily used for lighting purposes. If lighting is required, the City may review the available \nlighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the \nsurrounding views. Lighting shall be shielded or directed to the greatest extent possible so as to \nminimize the amount of glare and light falling onto nearby properties, particularly residences. \n5. Landscape and Fencing Requirements. \na. WCFs shall be sited in a manner that does not reduce the landscaped areas for the other \nprincipal uses on the parcel, below Code standards.  \nb. WCFs shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of \nthe WCF from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of the front, \nside, and rear landscaped setback on the perimeter of the site.  \nc. In locations where the visual impact of the WCF would be minimal, the landscaping \nrequirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the City Manager or assigned \ndesignee.  \nd. Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the \nmaximum extent possible. In some cases, such as WCFs sited on large, wooded lots, natural \ngrowth around the site perimeter may be sufficient to buffer. \n6. Noise.  Noise generated on the site must not exceed the levels permitted in the City Code, \nexcept that a WCF owner or operator shall be permitted to exceed City Code noise standards for \na reasonable period of time during repairs, not to exceed two (2) hours without prior \nauthorization from the City Manager. \n7. Additional design requirements shall be applicable to the various types of WCFs as specified \nbelow: \na. Base Stations. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a Tower, such as a Base \nStation (including, but not limited to the antennas and accessory equipment) it shall be of a \nneutral, non-reflective color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the \nsupporting structure, or uses other camouflage/concealment design techniques so as to \nmake the antenna and related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible.  \nb. Alternative Tower Structures. Alternative Tower Structures shall be designed and \nconstructed to look like a building, facility, or structure typically found in the area.  \nc. Alternative Tower Structures located in the Right-of-Way. In addition to the other criteria \ncontained in this Section, an Alternative Tower Structure located in the Right-of-Way shall:  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n245 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \ni. \nWith respect to its pole-mounted components, be located on an existing utility pole \nserving another utility; or  \nii. \nBe camouflaged/concealed consistent with other existing natural or manmade features \nin the right-of-way near the location where the Alternative Tower Structure will be \nlocated; or  \niii. \nWith respect to its pole components, be located on a new utility pole where other utility \ndistribution lines are aerial, if there are no reasonable alternatives, and the Applicant is \nauthorized to construct the new utility poles; or  \niv. \nTo the extent reasonably feasible, be consistent with the size and shape of the pole-\nmounted equipment installed by communications companies on utility poles near the \nAlternative Tower Structure.  \nv. \nBe sized to minimize the negative aesthetic impacts to the right-of-way.  \nvi. \nBe designed such that antenna installations on traffic signal standards are placed in a \nmanner so that the size, appearance, and function of the signal will not be considerably \naltered.  \nvii. \nRequire that any ground mounted equipment shall be located in a manner necessary to \naddress both public safety and aesthetic concerns in the reasonable discretion of the \nCity Manager, and may, where appropriate, require a flush-to-grade underground \nequipment vault; and  \nviii. \nNot alter vehicular circulation or parking within the Right-of-Way or impede vehicular, \nbicycle, or pedestrian access or visibility along the right-of-way. The Alternative Tower \nStructure must comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act and every other local, \nstate, and federal law and regulations. No Alternative Tower Structure may be located \nor maintained in a manner that causes unreasonable interference. Unreasonable \ninterference means any use of the Right-of-Way that disrupts or interferes with its use \nby the City, the general public, or other person authorized to use or be present upon the \nright-of-way, when there exists an alternative that would result in less disruption or \ninterference. Unreasonable interference includes any use of the right-of-way that \ndisrupts vehicular or pedestrian traffic, any interference with public utilities, and any \nother activity that will present a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare.  \n8. Towers. \na. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, or, subject to any applicable FAA \nstandards, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness as determined by \nthe City;  \nb. Tower structures should use existing landforms, vegetation, and structures to aid in \nscreening the facility from view or blending in with the surrounding built and natural \nenvironment.  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n246 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nc. Monopole support structures shall taper from the base to the tip;  \nd. All Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing or wall at least six (6) feet in height and shall \nalso be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device.  \n9. Related Accessory Equipment. Accessory equipment for all WCFs shall meet the following \nrequirements: \na. All buildings, shelter, cabinets, and other accessory components shall be grouped as closely \nas technically possible;  \nb. The total footprint coverage area of the WCF's accessory equipment shall not exceed three \nhundred fifty (350) square feet;  \nc. No related accessory equipment or accessory structure shall exceed fifteen (15) feet in \nheight;  \nd. Accessory equipment, including but not limited to remote radio units, shall be located out of \nsight whenever possible by locating behind parapet walls or within equipment enclosures. \nWhere such alternate locations are not available, the accessory equipment shall be \ncamouflaged or concealed.  \nE. Review Procedures and Requirements. No new WCF shall be constructed and no collocation or \nmodification to any WCF may occur except after a written request from an Applicant, reviewed and \napproved by the City in accordance with this Chapter. All WCFs shall be reviewed pursuant to the \nfollowing procedures: \n1. Submittal Requirements. In addition to an application form, No Public Safety Interference \nLetter, and submittal fees, each Applicant shall submit a scaled site plan, photo simulation, \nscaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, \nsigned and sealed by appropriate qualified professionals, showing the location and dimension of \nall improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, \ntower height, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, drainage, and other \ninformation deemed by the City Manager to be necessary to assess compliance with this \nSection.  \n2. Inventory of Existing Sites. Each Applicant for a WCF shall provide to the City Manager a \nnarrative and map description of the Applicant's existing or then currently proposed WCFs \nwithin the City, and outside of the City within one (1) mile of its boundaries. In addition, the \nApplicant shall inform the City generally of the areas of the City in which it believes WCFs may \nneed to be located within the next three (3) years. The inventory list should identify the site \nname, site address, and a general description of the facility (i.e. \u2014 rooftop antennas and ground \nmounted equipment). This provision is not intended to be a requirement that the Applicant \nsubmit its business plan, proprietary information, or make commitments regarding locations of \nWCFs within the City. Rather, it is an attempt to provide a mechanism for the City and all \nApplicants for WCFs to share general information, assist in the City's comprehensive planning \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n247 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nprocess, and promote collocation by identifying areas in which WCFs might be appropriately \nconstructed for multiple users.  \nThe City Manager may share such information with other Applicants applying for administrative \napprovals or conditional permits under this Section or other organizations seeking to locate \nWCFs within the jurisdiction of the City, provided however, that the City Manager is not, by \nsharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or \nsuitable.  \n3. Applications for Base Stations, Alternative Tower Structures and Alternative Tower Structures \nwithin Right-of-Way, shall be reviewed by the City Manager for conformance to this Section and \nCode using the administrative Site Plan review process set forth in Section 14-30.C.  Should the \nCity Manager consider the proposed WCF to have a significant visual impact, (i.e. proximity to \nhistorical sites) or otherwise be incompatible with the structure or surrounding area, or not \nmeet the intent of these provisions, the City Manager may refer the application to City Council \nfor approval, after a recommendation by the Planning, Zoning, and Variance Commission. \n4. All other Towers may be permitted only as a Conditional Use by the Planning, Zoning, and \nVariance Commission.  All applications for Towers shall demonstrate that other alternative \ndesign options such as Base Stations or Alternative Tower Structures are not viable options as \ndetermined by the City. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no Towers \nlocated in the Right-of-Way shall exceed twenty-five (25) in height.  \n5. Additional Review Procedures for Collocations. \na. Application. The City shall prepare, and from time to time revise and make publicly \navailable, an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for the \nCity to consider whether an application for collocation is an Eligible Facilities Request. Such \ninformation may include, without limitation, whether the project:  \ni. \nWould result in a Substantial Change;  \nii. \nViolates a generally applicable law, regulations, or other rule reasonably related to \npublic health and safety.  \niii. \nThe application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case \nfor the proposed modification or collocation.  \nb. Type of Review. Upon receipt of an application for an Eligible Facilities Request pursuant to \nthis Section, the City Manager shall review such application to determine whether the \napplication so qualifies.  \nc. Timeframe for Review. Subject to the tolling provisions of subsection (5)d., within sixty (60) \ndays of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this \nSection, the City shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is \nnot covered by this subsection.  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n248 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nd. Tolling of the Timeframe for Review. The sixty (60) day review period begins to run when \nthe application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement of the City and the \nApplicant, or in cases where the City Manager determines that the application is \nincomplete:  \ni. \nTo toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the City must provide written notice to the \nApplicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application, specifically delineating all \nmissing documents or information required in the application;  \nii. \nThe timeframe for review begins running again when the Applicant makes a \nsupplemental written submission in response to the City's notice of incompleteness; and  \niii. \nFollowing a supplemental submission, the City will notify the Applicant within ten (10) \ndays that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the \noriginal notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of \nsecond or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in subsection (5)d.i. \nIn the case of a second or subsequent notice of incompleteness, the City may not specify \nmissing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of \nincompleteness.   \ne. Failure to Act. In the event the City fails to act on a request seeking approval for an Eligible \nFacilities Request under this Section within the timeframe for review (accounting for any \ntolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant becomes effective when \nthe Applicant notifies the City in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for \nany tolling) that the application has been deemed granted.  \nf. Interaction with Telecommunications Act Section 332(c)(7). If the City determines that the \nApplicant's request is not an Eligible Facilities Request as delineated in this Chapter, the \npresumptively reasonable timeframe under Section 332(c)(7), as prescribed by the FCC's \nShot Clock order, will begin to run from the issuance of the City's decision that the \napplication is not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, the City \nmay request additional information from the Applicant to evaluate the application under \nSection 332(c)(7) reviews. \n6. Abandonment and Removal. Prior to approval, affidavits shall be required from the owner of \nthe property and from the Applicant acknowledging that each is responsible for the removal of a \nWCF that is abandoned or is unused for a period of six (6) months. \n7.
