shall be based entirely on the evidence presented at the hearing. \u00a0Utility service shall not be discontinued until\nafter the hearing officer has rendered his or her decision. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (e) Utility service shall not be discontinued: \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(i) If all current utility bills are paid when due and all past due amounts are being amortized by reasonable\ninstallment payments. \u00a0The due date of the bill must specifically be indicated on the bill and the due date shall be no\nearlier than twenty (20) days subsequent to the mailing or delivery of the bill. \u00a0\u201cCurrent bill\u201d means that portion of\nthe bill which is not twenty (20) days past due. \u00a0The minimum reasonable installment payment is that which pays a\ncurrent bill in full and at least one-sixth (1/6 \u00a0th \u00a0) of any past-due balance. \u00a0A reasonable installment payment plan\nmay require that a past-due balance be paid off in no more than six (6) equal monthly installments. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(ii) between 12:00 Noon on Friday and 8:00 a.m. the following Monday, or between 12:00 Noon on the day prior to\nand 8:00 a.m. on the day following any federal holiday or City-observed holiday. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(iii) \u00a0during any period when discontinuance of service would be especially dangerous to the health or safety of the\nresidential customer or a permanent resident of the customer\u2019s household, and such customer established that he or\nshe is unable to pay for the service as regularly billed, or he or she is able to pay for such service but only in\nreasonable installments. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Discontinuance of service that would be especially dangerous to the health or safety of the residential customer or a\npermanent resident of the customer\u2019s household means that discontinuance of service would aggravate an existing\nmedical condition or create a medical emergency for the customer or a permanent resident of the customer\u2019s\nhousehold. \u00a0Such shall be deemed to be the case when a physician licensed by the State of Colorado makes a\ncertification thereof in writing and said certification is received by the City. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0In the event a medical certification, as aforesaid, is delivered to or received by the City, the non-discontinuance of\nservice as herein prescribed shall be effective for sixty (60) days from the date of said medical certification. \u00a0One (1)\nthirty (30) day extension of non-discontinuance of service pursuant to this Section 12-4(c)(1)(iii) may be effected by\ndelivery to or receipt by the City of a second medical certification, as aforesaid, prior to the expiration of the initial\nsixty (60) day non-discontinuance period. \u00a0A residential customer may invoke the provisions of this Section 12-4(c)\n(1)(iii) no more than once during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(iv) \u00a0until the City has made a reasonable effort to give notice of the proposed discontinuance in person or by\ntelephone both to the customer (or to a resident of the customer\u2019s household 18 years of age or over) and to any third\nparty who is listed by the customer on a third-party notification form. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(v) \u00a0in the event a customer at any time tenders full payment of any utility bill by cash or bona fide check to a\nservice representative. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 (f) Any customer who is mailed a notice of discontinuance shall be assessed a Ten Dollar ($10.00) fee to cover\nadministrative costs in addition to the original amount of the utility bill and any penalty assessed. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (g) Wherever reference is made herein to a notice or other document being mailed or delivered, that phrase shall mean\nthat the notice or other document is either deposited in the United States mails, or physically delivered to the address of\nthe addressee, and does not necessarily include actual physical receipt by the addressee. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (2) Discontinuance under hazardous conditions or meter bypass. \u00a0These rules regarding discontinuance of service shall\nnot apply where a meter bypass of any kind is discovered on a customer\u2019s service meter, or where any hazardous condition\nexists on a customer\u2019s premises, or in the case of a customer utilizing utility service in such a manner as to make it\ndangerous for occupants of the premises, thus making an immediate discontinuance of service necessary. \u00a0In such\ncircumstances, utility service will be immediately disconnected and will not be reconnected until the customer pays the\nfollowing charges to the City: \u00a0\n\u00a0 (a) \u00a0A service charge calculated to compensate the City for all reasonable expenses incurred on account of such\ncondition, including, but not limited to, costs of investigation, disconnection, reconnection, and service calls, but in\nno event less than $40.00; and \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 (b) \u00a0The cost of repairing or replacing any damaged utility equipment; and \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 (c) \u00a0The actual or estimated charges not previously billed to the customer as a result of any tampering, bypassing, or\nunauthorized metering. \u00a0\nSection 12-4.1.

The presiding officer shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence, and no\ninformality in any proceeding or in the manner of taking testimony shall invalidate any order, decision, rule, or regulation\nmade, approved, or confirmed. \u00a0However, to the extent practicable, the Colorado Rules of Evidence applicable in civil non-\ninjury cases in the district courts of Colorado will be followed in order to promote uniformity in the admission of evidence.\n\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, when necessary to ascertain facts affecting the substantial rights of parties to the\nproceeding, evidence not admissible under such rules may be received and considered if such evidence possesses probative\nvalue commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. \u00a0\n(15) Burden of going forward and burden of proof. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (a) \u00a0In formal complaint proceedings, the burden of going forward and the burden of proof shall be on the\ncomplainant. \u00a0After the complainant has gone forward, any party who appears in support of the position of the\ncomplainant shall go forward. \u00a0Then the City or its representative, followed by any party who appears in support of\nthe position of the City, shall go forward. \u00a0The complainant shall then have the right to present rebuttal evidence. \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 (b) \u00a0In proceedings other than formal complaint proceedings, the burden of going forward and the burden of proof\nshall be as determined by the presiding officer. \u00a0\n(16) Additional Guidelines.
