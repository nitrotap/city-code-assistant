criticism of the City of Trinidad, City Council, City employees, or\nCity management. Members of subordinate City boards and commissions serve at the pleasure of City Council, and may be\nremoved from their position for cause by a majority vote of City Council. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nSection 2-71.1 Rules of Ethics.  \n(1) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Confidentiality.\nIt is of the utmost importance that board and commission members keep confidential matters confidential, and hold\ninviolate information that is entrusted to them as part of their official duties. While many matters will be entrusted to\nboard and commission members with the expectation and belief that the commission member will keep the matter\nconfidential, there are certain matters that are, and must be, kept confidential under all circumstances. \u00a0Such confidential\ninformation includes, but is not limited to:\n(a) \u00a0Executive Sessions: \u00a0it is required that all matters imparted or discussed during an executive session be kept\nconfidential. \u00a0This requirement applies to all participants/attendees of an executive session, but especially so for the\nboard and commission members present at the executive session. \u00a0Everything that is discussed, the viewpoints\nexpressed, or the leanings of individual members all must be kept confidential. \u00a0 This is especially so for legal advice\ngiven during executive sessions. \u00a0In such matters, the confidentiality considerations are heightened by\nattorney/client principles, as well as the requirements of the confidentiality of executive sessions. \u00a0 \u00a0 The content of\nsuch executive session shall be kept confidential unless it is decided by a majority of City Council to make the matter\npublic. \u00a0Board or commission members may lose insurance coverage for revealing matters that are discussed in\nexecutive session.\n(b) \u00a0Legal Advice Given Outside of Executive Session: a member of a board or commission may receive legal advice in\ntheir capacity as a municipal official in several ways. \u00a0Legal advice given publicly or during a meeting clearly does not\ncarry with it the need for confidentiality, nor can it be expected to be kept confidential. \u00a0A board or commission\nmember must differentiate, however, between legal advice given previously in a confidential session/discussion and\nwhat has been discussed or revealed publicly. \u00a0\n(c) \u00a0Quasi-Judicial Matters: \u00a0matters shared with board or commission members during, before, or after a quasi-\njudicial matter must absolutely remain confidential, so as to not jeopardize the integrity of the decision making\nprocess.\u00a0\n(d) \u00a0Other Confidential Matters: There will be other matters entrusted to board and commission members in their\nofficial capacities as well, where the board member will be asked, or expected, to keep a matter or matters\nconfidential. \u00a0Usually the person imparting the confidential information will declare the information confidential\nbefore the discussion regarding the information, but in some instances it should be a matter of common sense as to\ninformation that should be kept confidential. \u00a0\n(2) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lawful Compliance.\nBoard or commission members shall be expected and required to be law abiding during their tenure in office. Law abiding\nshall mean free of criminal convictions consisting of: \u00a0felonies, misdemeanors, class one traffic offenses, or criminal\nviolations of the Trinidad municipal code. Criminal convictions shall not be taken to mean convictions for traffic offenses,\nlower than a class one traffic offense. \u00a0 \u00a0A conviction of a crime under state statute, federal statute, or the Trinidad\nMunicipal Code or other municipal codes may result in the recommendation of the resignation of a member of City\nCouncil or a member of a subordinate board or commission, a vote of no confidence by a majority vote of City Council, or\nthe removal of a member of a subordinate board or commission by a majority vote of City Council.\nBoard or commission members must also abide by and adhere to the Trinidad Municipal Charter, and adhere to the\nrequirements and legal standards set forth therein. \u00a0Repeated violations of the Trinidad Municipal Charter by an\nindividual City Council or board or commission member shall be treated as a violation of any other portion of the Code of\nEthics or Code of Conduct. \u00a0If City Council, or a subordinate board or commission, shall inadvertently violate the Trinidad\nCity Charter, it shall not be deemed a violation by any individual member or all of the Council or a subordinate board or\ncommission. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(3) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Conflicts of Interest.\nBoard and commission members have a fiduciary responsibility to their constituents and to the people that transact\nbusiness and come before them to ensure that their decision making is independent, unbiased, and free from\ninappropriate outside influences. \u00a0Stated conversely, it is of paramount importance that board and commission members\nmake decisions in the best interests of Trinidad, and not themselves, their friends or family members. \u00a0Conflicts of interest\ncan and will arise for board and commission members in many ways. \u00a0It is vital to the decision making process that board\nand commission members exercise independent judgment free of conflicts of interest. \u00a0As always, if a board or commission\nmember believes he or she has a conflict of interest, the best course of action is to err on the side of disclosure in revealing\nthe potential or actual conflict, and seek the advice of staff, and the legal advice of the city attorney, in such a situation.\nThe standard that shall be adopted for purposes of this Code is that if there is a substantial appearance of impropriety, the\nappearance of self-dealing, or the likelihood of an impossibility or improbability of being able to exercise independent\njudgment, as determined by a reasonable person standard. \u00a0That is, would a reasonable person in the board or commission\nmember\u2019s position have their ability to fairly decide a matter compromised, impaired by, or would there be the appearance\nof impropriety, with respect to an outside matter that would make it less likely to render an impartial decision based\nentirely on the matter presented to the board or commission member? \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(a) \u00a0A direct conflict of interest: \u00a0\nA direct conflict of interest shall involve or deal with any decision a board or commission member would be required\nto make that would affect said member\u2019s business or financial interests; the business or financial interests of a\ncompetitor business; any matter that a board or commission member has a direct financial interest in; any matter\nthat would similarly benefit a board or commission member\u2019s family or family member, or their financial interests.\n\u00a0A direct conflict of interest reflects directly on one\u2019s ability to fairly judge or consider a matter, and shall always be\ndisqualifying for a board or commission member. \u00a0\u00a0\n(b) \u00a0An indirect or potential conflict of interest:\nThere will be times when a board or commission member will have a conflict of interest that is not a direct conflict,\nbut could or would rise to the level of a conflict of interest nonetheless. \u00a0The appearance of impropriety standard\nwould apply to such situations, and if it does appear that the board or commission member would have their ability\nto exercise independent and impartial judgment reasonably questioned, the member should move to recuse or\ndisqualify him or herself. \u00a0\nIf a board or commission member suspects that they may have a conflict of interest, the member should not take any\naction with respect to the matter until the question of the conflict of interest can be resolved. \u00a0A board or commission\nmember should raise or discuss the possibility of a conflict of interest as soon as they suspect that they may have a\nconflict. \u00a0Also, one should not attempt to influence one\u2019s fellow members of a board or commission, or members of\nsubordinate boards or commissions, on any matter within which they may have a conflict of interest. \u00a0This is\nespecially true of matters of a quasi- judicial nature.\u00a0\n(4) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Communications. \u00a0 \u00a0\nBoard or Commission members must not run afoul of the Colorado Open Meetings Law, and discuss city business with\nmore than one of their fellow board or commission members. \u00a0Communications between three board or commission\nmembers or more without a meeting having been properly noticed is a violation of the Colorado Open Meetings Law. \u00a0A\nboard or commission member shall not initiate, encourage, or participate in or continue a meeting that one knows or\nreasonably should have known is in violation of the Colorado Open Meetings Law. \u00a0This shall include communication by\nway of email or text messaging, as a group email or group text to two or more members of a board or commission would\nconstitute a meeting in contravention of the Colorado Open Meetings Law. \u00a0\n(5) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Nepotism.\nA board or commission member shall not attempt to benefit a family member by obtaining employment for them, having a\ncity contract awarded to a family member, or otherwise acting in one\u2019s official capacity to benefit, promote or elevate a\nfamily member. \u00a0These rules should apply to a board or commission member\u2019s close friends as well, and again, the\nappearance of impropriety standard should apply to this situation as well. \u00a0All rules with respect to conflicts of interest\napply to matters of nepotism, and it is a clear conflict and/or misuse of office to try to benefit or advance a family member\nin one\u2019s capacity as a board or commission member.\u00a0\nNepotism rules and considerations should be applied and construed strictly to personnel matters, and a board or\ncommission member should not try to interfere with or influence City management regarding the hiring/firing of a family\nmember or friend, or if already part of the City work force, their work performance, disciplinary matters, or any\ninvestigative or disciplinary matter undertaken by the City regarding that friend or family member.\n(6) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Emoluments/Gifts.\nA board or commission member should not accept a gift with more than $50.00 in value. \u00a0A board or commission member\nshould never accept services in lieu of or as a gift, if it relates to their being a board or commission member. \u00a0 \u00a0\nSection 2-71.2 Violations / Sanctions.\nIf a violation of this Ethics Code or the Code of Conduct is proven, the Ethics Board shall elect from the following options\nthe punitive sanction to be imposed:\n---to issue a public warning, verbal or written;\n---to issue a public reprimand or censure, verbal or written;\n---to issue a written public admonishment;\nA public warning shall be the least severe form of punishment, followed by a public reprimand/censure, with the most\nsevere form of punishment being a public admonishment.\nAs part of an adjudication of wrongdoing and the imposition of a punitive sanction being imposed per the above, the Board\nof Ethics may also recommend or strongly encourage the Respondent to attend remedial education or training given by an\norganization such as CIRSA or the Colorado Municipal League regarding the issues that gave rise to the complaint.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0In considering what punishment to impose, the Board of Ethics shall consider:\n---the severity of the misconduct;\n---whether the member has been the subject of an ethics proceeding before, \u00a0especially as it concerns the conduct\ncomplained of, and whether the present proceeding is of the same subject matter as prior ethics complaints/proceedings;\n---the facts giving rise to the complaint, the mitigation or aggravation of the alleged misconduct, and;\n---whether the Council or board or commission member is likely to repeat the conduct that gave rise to the complaint.\u00a0\nThe Ethics Board does not have the authority to remove a member of City Council, but does have that authority with a\nmember of a subordinate board or commission. \u00a0The Ethics Board shall not have the authority to levy a fine or impose\nother sanctions not specified by this Code. \u00a0 \u00a0\nSection 2-71.3 Code of Conduct.\nThis Code of Conduct is designed to set forth and memorialize tenants of good conduct for board and commission\nmembers, in facilitating how such members deal with and interact with each other, the public, and staff in their municipal\ncapacities. \u00a0This Code of Conduct should be used in conjunction with each individual board and commission member\u2019s\nsense of decency, respect, kindness to others and desire to pursue excellence in municipal affairs. \u00a0By getting along with\neach other, members of boards or commissions are better able to focus on the business at hand, rather than focusing on\nindividual personalities or issues with each other. \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nBoard and Commission members shall:\n(a) \u00a0While serving a term as an elected or appointed member of a Trinidad board or commission, be mindful that you\nare always representing the City of Trinidad, even when not conducting official business.\u00a0\n(b) \u00a0Be respectful of everyone and everyone\u2019s viewpoints, including your peers on your particular board or\ncommission. \u00a0Treat them as you yourself would and do want to be treated;\n(c) \u00a0Don\u2019t scold, admonish, belittle or diminish others in meetings, especially for taking a position you don\u2019t agree\nwith. \u00a0If you have a personal issue with one of your colleagues, address it respectfully after the meeting. \u00a0This applies\nto members of the public addressing or being involved in any proceeding with a board or commission;\n(d) \u00a0Similarly, don\u2019t scold, berate, belittle, admonish, or publicly criticize staff during meetings. \u00a0Should you have an\nissue with a staff member during a meeting, feel free to talk to them after the meeting, or direct criticisms about staff\nto the City Manager if necessary;\u00a0\n(e) \u00a0Outside of meetings, act in furtherance of the stated policies or decisions of the City in general and your board or\ncommission in particular, not in defiance of them. \u00a0Carry out the will of your particular board or commission if\nknown, not your own individual agenda;\u00a0\n(f) \u00a0 Honor and respect settled law and or policies of the City of Trinidad. \u00a0One can disagree with those laws and or\npolicies personally, but shouldn\u2019t criticize them or the policy makers for deciding what or how they decided; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(g) \u00a0 Adhere to the Trinidad Code of Ethics;\n(h) \u00a0Recognize the presiding officer and his or her authority while conducting the meeting; \u00a0\u00a0\n(i) \u00a0Remember that one of the most important reflections of a City, and a City\u2019s reputation, is how well meetings are\nconducted, especially that of City Council. \u00a0The better all of the constituent parts function, the better members get\nalong, the more that gets accomplished in an efficient, expeditious yet thorough manner, the better the City looks to\nthe outside world. \u00a0Respecting each other, the public and staff, being prepared, setting aside petty personal agendas,\nand focusing on the business at hand are all the hallmarks of a City board or commission to be proud of, and;.\n(j) \u00a0Recognize the presiding officer as such, and \u201cpoints of order\u201d and \u201cpoints of personal privilege\u201d notwithstanding,\nrespecting his or her authority while conducting the meeting. \u00a0 \u00a0One can always address a matter with the presiding\nofficer after the meeting, and express concerns or issues then. \u00a0The more a board or commission member maintains\ntheir composure and professionalism during something the individual board or commission member doesn\u2019t agree\nwith, the greater the likelihood of a rational result.\u00a0\nThis Code of Conduct, while setting forth standards of positive and favorable conduct, are primarily aspirational, and\ntherefore recommendations, rather that mandatory principles as set forth in the Code of Ethics. \u00a0However, repeated\nviolations of this Code of Conduct may, and shall be, enforceable as would an alleged violation of the Code of Ethics. \u00a0(Ord.\n2075, Sec 2-71 repealed and re-enacted, eff. 5-17-19)\nARTICLE 18.

SI NO SE PUEDE LEER ESTE AVISO EN INGL\u00c9S, ES\nNECESARIO QUE ALGUIEN LO TRADUZCA. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 (Ord. 1991, Sec 12-4 (1)(a), repealed and reenacted, 10/16/15) \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 (b) At a minimum, said notice shall advise the customer: \u00a0\n\u00a0 (i) \u00a0How to contact the City to resolve any dispute with respect to the amount or date due, and/or with respect to\nviolation of any rule. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (ii) \u00a0That the customer is entitled to a hearing in person, prior to a discontinuance of service, at a reasonable time\nand place within ten (10) days of the date of the notice of discontinuance before an impartial hearing officer, to\nprotest or dispute the grounds provided for the proposed discontinuance. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (iii) \u00a0That the customer

that the customer is entitled to have an\ninterpreter present at the hearing if same is requested at the time the request for hearing is made. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (iv) \u00a0That the customer who is unable to pay for service as regularly billed by the City may avoid termination of\nservice by paying the current month\u2019s bill in full and entering into a reasonable installment plan with the City to pay\nany past-due balance in no more than six (6) equal monthly installments. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (v) \u00a0That in the event the customer is unable to pay for service as regularly billed by the City, or is able to pay for\nsuch service but only in reasonable installments, and there is a medical certification delivered to the City indicating\nthat termination of service would be especially dangerous to the health or safety of the customer or a permanent\nresident of the customer\u2019s household, that there will not be discontinuance of service for sixty (60) days from the\ndate of the medical extension. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (c) If the customer does not request a hearing by the date on which the request must be made, and the required payment\nis not made by the proposed date of discontinuance, utility service shall be subject to discontinuance. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (d) If the customer requests a hearing, a hearing shall be scheduled and held as soon as practicable following such\nrequest. \u00a0The impartial hearing officer shall be the City Manager and/or the City Manager\u2019s designee. \u00a0The hearing shall be\nconducted informally and recorded, said recording to be kept for a

Utility service shall not be discontinued: \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(i) If all current utility bills are paid when due and all past due amounts are being amortized by reasonable\ninstallment payments. \u00a0The due date of the bill must specifically be indicated on the bill and the due date shall be no\nearlier than twenty (20) days subsequent to the mailing or delivery of the bill. \u00a0\u201cCurrent bill\u201d means that portion of\nthe bill which is not twenty (20) days past due. \u00a0The minimum reasonable installment payment is that which pays a\ncurrent bill in full and at least one-sixth (1/6 \u00a0th \u00a0) of any past-due balance. \u00a0A reasonable installment payment plan\nmay require that a past-due balance be paid off in no more than six (6) equal monthly installments. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(ii) between 12:00 Noon on Friday and 8:00 a.m. the following Monday, or between 12:00 Noon on the day prior to\nand 8:00 a.m. on the day following any federal holiday or City-observed holiday. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(iii) \u00a0during any period when discontinuance of service would be especially dangerous to the health or safety of the\nresidential customer or a permanent resident of the customer\u2019s household, and such customer established that he or\nshe is unable to pay for the service as regularly billed, or he or she is able to pay for such service but only in\nreasonable installments. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Discontinuance of service that would be especially dangerous to the health or safety of the residential customer or a\npermanent resident of the customer\u2019s household means that discontinuance of service would aggravate an existing\nmedical condition or create a medical emergency for the customer or a permanent resident of the customer\u2019s\nhousehold. \u00a0Such shall be deemed to be the case when a physician licensed by the State of Colorado makes a\ncertification thereof in writing and said certification is received by the City. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0In the event a medical certification, as aforesaid, is delivered to or received by the City, the non-discontinuance of\nservice as herein prescribed shall be effective for sixty (60) days from the date of said medical certification. \u00a0One (1)\nthirty (30) day extension of non-discontinuance of service pursuant to this Section 12-4(c)(1)(iii) may be effected by\ndelivery to or receipt by the City of a second medical certification, as aforesaid, prior to the expiration of the initial\nsixty (60) day non-discontinuance period. \u00a0A residential customer may invoke the provisions of this Section 12-4(c)\n(1)(iii) no more than once during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(iv) \u00a0until the City has made a reasonable effort to give notice of the proposed discontinuance in person or by\ntelephone both to the customer (or to a resident of the customer\u2019s household 18 years of age or over) and to any third\nparty who is listed by the customer on a third-party notification form. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0(v) \u00a0in the event a customer at any time tenders full payment of any utility bill by cash or bona fide check to a\nservice representative. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 (f) Any customer who is mailed a notice of discontinuance shall be assessed a Ten Dollar ($10.00) fee to cover\nadministrative costs in addition to the original amount of the utility bill and any penalty assessed. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (g) Wherever reference is made herein to a notice or other document being mailed or delivered, that phrase shall mean\nthat the notice or other document is either deposited in the United States mails, or physically delivered to the address of\nthe addressee, and does not necessarily include actual physical receipt by the addressee. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (2) Discontinuance under hazardous conditions or meter bypass. \u00a0These rules regarding discontinuance of service shall\nnot apply where a meter bypass of any kind is discovered on a customer\u2019s service meter, or where any hazardous condition\nexists on a customer\u2019s premises, or in the case of a customer utilizing utility service in such a manner as to make it\ndangerous for occupants of the premises, thus making an immediate discontinuance of service necessary. \u00a0In such\ncircumstances, utility service will be immediately disconnected and will not be reconnected until the customer pays the\nfollowing charges to the City: \u00a0\n\u00a0 (a) \u00a0A service charge calculated to compensate the City for all reasonable expenses incurred on account of such\ncondition, including, but not limited to, costs of investigation, disconnection, reconnection, and service calls, but in\nno event less than $40.00; and \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 (b) \u00a0The cost of repairing or replacing any damaged utility equipment; and \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 (c) \u00a0The actual or estimated charges not previously billed to the customer as a result of any tampering, bypassing, or\nunauthorized metering. \u00a0\nSection 12-4.1.

The presiding officer shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence, and no\ninformality in any proceeding or in the manner of taking testimony shall invalidate any order, decision, rule, or regulation\nmade, approved, or confirmed. \u00a0However, to the extent practicable, the Colorado Rules of Evidence applicable in civil non-\ninjury cases in the district courts of Colorado will be followed in order to promote uniformity in the admission of evidence.\n\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, when necessary to ascertain facts affecting the substantial rights of parties to the\nproceeding, evidence not admissible under such rules may be received and considered if such evidence possesses probative\nvalue commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. \u00a0\n(15) Burden of going forward and burden of proof. \u00a0\n\u00a0 (a) \u00a0In formal complaint proceedings, the burden of going forward and the burden of proof shall be on the\ncomplainant. \u00a0After the complainant has gone forward, any party who appears in support of the position of the\ncomplainant shall go forward. \u00a0Then the City or its representative, followed by any party who appears in support of\nthe position of the City, shall go forward. \u00a0The complainant shall then have the right to present rebuttal evidence. \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 (b) \u00a0In proceedings other than formal complaint proceedings, the burden of going forward and the burden of proof\nshall be as determined by the presiding officer. \u00a0\n(16) Additional Guidelines.

CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS (CUP) \nA. Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Purpose. In order to provide flexibility and to help diversify uses \nwithin a zoning district, specified uses are permitted in certain districts subject to the granting of a \nconditional use permit. Specific conditional uses for each zone district are listed in the Table 14-42 \nUse Table. \nB. Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Review Process. All applications for conditional uses will be reviewed \naccording to the procedures set forth in Section 14-27 Limited Impact Review Procedures. \nAdministrative conditional uses will be reviewed according to procedures set forth in 14-25 \nAdministrative Review Procedures. \nC. Expiration of Conditional Use Permit. \n1. Conditional use permit approval shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of approval \nor within a longer period determined by the Administrator or Planning Zoning, and \nVariance Commission, as applicable, for uses which involve phasing, but in no event \nlonger than three (3) years from the date of approval. The conditional use approval may \ncontain conditions as deemed appropriate by the Administrator or Planning Zoning, and \nVariance Commission in approving the permit. Within the one-year period, or other \napproved period, the permit holder must either begin construction or establish the land \nuse authorized by the conditional use permit, including any conditions attached to the \nconditional use approval. The permit holder must continue to operate the land use or \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-43. Conditional Use Permits (CUP) \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n76 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nbusiness in a manner consistent with normal practices for the intended use. Failure to \nstart construction, establish, or operate such use within the one-year or other applicable \ntime period shall result in automatic expiration of the conditional use permit. Once a \nconditional use is established, any discontinuance of the use for a period of one (1) year, \nfor any reason, shall result in automatic expiration of the conditional use permit, unless \notherwise provided in the permit.  The approval of a conditional use may or may not \nidentify an initial term for the conditional use as determined by the Planning Zoning, \nand Variance Commission.  A conditional use may be brought back to the Planning \nZoning, and Variance Commission if there are neighborhood, expiration of land use, or \nviolations of City codes or conditions. Upon expiration of the term, if the permit is so \nlimited, the conditional use permit shall automatically expire.   \n2. Prior to expiration of the initial term or an extended term, the applicant may submit a \nrequest to the Administrator to extend the conditional use approval, which request shall \nspecify the reasons why the use should be permitted to continue. The approval shall be \ndeemed extended until the Administrator or Planning Commission, as applicable, has \nacted upon the request for extension. The City shall be authorized to deny an extension \nor extend the approval and to impose additional conditions, if necessary. \nD. Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Application Review Criteria. A conditional use permit application is \nsubject to the following approval criteria. It is the applicant\u2019s burden to demonstrate, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that each of the following criteria is satisfied by the application: \n1. The conditional use will satisfy all applicable provisions of the Code. \n2. The conditional use will conform with or further the goals and strategies set forth in the \nComprehensive Plan. \n3. The conditional use will be adequately served with public utilities, services, and facilities (i.e. \nwater, wastewater, electric, gas, schools, street system, fire protection, public transit, storm \ndrainage, solid waste collection, parks system, etc.) and not impose an undue burden above \nand beyond those of the permitted uses of the district. \n4. The conditional use will not substantially alter the basic character of the district. \n5. The conditional use will result in efficient on- and off-site traffic circulation which will not \nhave a significant adverse impact on the adjacent uses or result in hazardous conditions for \npedestrians or vehicles in or adjacent to the site. \n6. All applicable permits and approvals from other agencies, entities or jurisdictions have been \nor will be obtained. \n7. Potential negative impacts of the conditional use on the rest of the neighborhood or of the \nneighborhood on the conditional use have been mitigated through setbacks, architecture, \nscreen walls, landscaping, site arrangement or other methods. The application shall address \nthe following potential negative impacts, at a minimum: \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-44. Expansion of the List of Permitted Uses \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n77 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \na.

Erosion control \nSection 14-44. EXPANSION OF THE LIST OF PERMITTED USES \nA. Upon application or on its own initiative, the City Council may, by ordinance, add to the uses listed \nfor a zone district any other similar use which conforms to the conditions set forth in the following \nspecial findings: \n1. Such use is appropriate to the general physical and environmental character of the district \nto which it is added. \n2. Such use does not create any more hazard to or alteration of the natural environment than \nthe minimum amount normally resulting from the other uses permitted in the district to \nwhich it is added. \n3. Such use does not create any more offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, \nor other objectionable influences or more traffic hazards than the minimum amount \nnormally resulting from the other uses permitted in the district to which it is added. \n4. Such use is compatible with the uses existing and permitted in the district to which it is \nadded and will not adversely affect the Historic Preservation District. \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-45. Administrative Adjustments \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n78 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nB. When any use has been added to the list of permitted uses in any district in accordance with this \nSection, such use shall be deemed to be listed in the appropriate section of this Article and shall be \nadded thereto at the time of adoption. \nSection 14-45. ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS \nA. Applicability. \n1. This Section authorizes the Director to make administrative adjustments to those development \nstandards listed below as part of other development approvals and applications under this Code. \n2. Administrative adjustments may only be used to adjust development standards on a single \nlot or two adjacent lots to address unique site constraints. \nTable 14-45: Administrative Adjustments \nOrdinance Standard \nAmount of Variation Permitted from Ordinance Standard \nAll Permits and Approvals \nBuilding setbacks \n25% \nMaximum lot coverage \n10% \nMaximum building height \n15% in Residential districts; 25% in other districts \nMaximum size of ADUs \n10% \nRoof Pitch \nReduction in roof pitch that is similar and complementary to or compatible \nwith the principal building.

ZONING \nSection 14-46. Amendments \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n79 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nB. Procedure. \nThere is no separate procedure for an Administrative Adjustment. Instead, applicants under Site \nPlans or Subdivision applications may include a request for an Administrative Adjustment with those \napplications. \nC. Criteria for Approval. \n1. The adjustment allows improved site or building design elements to be incorporated that \nare more consistent with the surrounding context; and \n2. The adjustment will impact permitted development standards on no more than two \nadjacent lots; and \n3. The adjustment addresses an unusual site constraint or unusual requirement of the \nproposed use or building that is not common to other lots, uses, or buildings in the \nsurrounding area; and \n4. The adjustment will have no material adverse impact on any abutting lot, or any material \nadverse impacts have been mitigated by conditions attached to the adjustment; and \n5. The adjustment does not violate any conditions of approval specifically applied to \ndevelopment of the property by the Planning, Zoning, and Variance Commission or City \nCouncil. \n6. For an adjustment to the maximum number or area of signs or sign setbacks, the adjustment will \nhave a minimal visual effect on the surrounding neighborhood and is necessary to compensate \nfor unusual shape or orientation of the lot or to allow sign visibility comparable to, but not \nexceeding, that available to nearby lots of approximately the same size and shape in the same \nzone district. \nSection 14-46. AMENDMENTS \nA. Authority. Amendments to the Zoning Map shall be in accordance with the statutes of the State of \nColorado, with recommendation from the Commission to the City Council prior to the adoption of \nany such amendment. Rezoning shall be completed in accordance with Section 14-28 Major Impact \nreview and subject to the following regulations.  \nB. Declaration of Policy and Criteria for Rezoning. \n1. For the purposes of establishing and maintaining sound, stable and desirable development \nwithin the City of Trinidad, the rezoning of land is to be discouraged and allowed only under \ncertain circumstances as provided hereafter. This policy is based on the opinion of the City \nCouncil that the City's zoning map is the result of a detailed and comprehensive appraisal of \nthe City's present and future needs regarding land use allocation and, as such, should not be \namended unless to correct a manifest error or because of changed or changing conditions in \na particular area or the City in general. \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-46. Amendments \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n80 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n2. Rezoning shall only be approved if the applicant demonstrates by a preponderance of the \nevidence that rezoning is necessary for one or more of the following reasons: \na. There was an error in establishing the current zoning. \nb. The area for which rezoning is requested has changed or is changing to such a \ndegree that it is in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or a \nnew approach to development; or \nc. The proposed rezoning is necessary in order to provide land for a community related \nuse which was not contemplated at the time of development of the comprehensive \nplan. \n3. In addition, no rezoning shall be approved unless the applicant demonstrates by a \npreponderance of the evidence that each of the following criteria are met: \na. That a change in zoning will advance a more effective use of land in harmony with the City\u2019s \ncomprehensive plan; \nb. The intensity of development in the new zoning district is not expected to create \nsignificantly adverse impacts to surrounding properties or the neighborhood; and \nc. Public facilities and services are available to adequately serve the subject property while \nmaintaining an adequate level of service to existing development. \n4. These standards do not apply to a legislative rezoning of the City\u2019s zoning map. \nC. Procedure for Amendments in General. \n1. Amendments to Zoning Regulations. The City Council may, from time to time, on its own \nmotion, on petition of an interested person, or by the recommendation of the Commission, \namend, supplement or repeal the regulations and provisions of this Article, following the \nprocedure (at least one public hearing) required by the Colorado Revised Statutes. \nD. Amendments to the Official Zoning Map. \n1. Planning, Zoning, and Variance Commission Advisory Report. Any proposed amendment to \nthe Zoning Map that is not initiated by the Commission shall be referred to the Commission. \n2. Procedure before Commission. Before giving an advisory report and recommendation on \nany proposed amendment to the Zoning Map, the Commission shall conduct a public \nhearing thereon and complete the public notice requirements according to subsection 14-\n46(D).4 below. \n3. Procedure before the City Council. After receiving the advisory report from the Planning, \nZoning, and Variance Commission, the City Council shall hold a public hearing and complete \nthe public notice requirements according to subsection 14-46(D).4 below before acting on \nthe proposed amendment. \n4. Rezoning Public Notice Requirements. Public notice requirements shall meet section 14-12. \nARTICLE 5. ZONING \nSection 14-46.

The intent \nof the community design standards is to create a vital, cohesive, well-designed community in order \nto enhance Trinidad\u2019s unique character and further the citizens\u2019 goals as identified in the Trinidad \nComprehensive Plan. \nB. Community Design Elements. \n1. Compact Urban Growth. As the community grows from the original City limits, it is \nimportant to maintain a continuity of density, diversity and interconnectedness. Urban \ndevelopment should occur adjacent to the City\u2019s core so that the community\u2019s rural land and \nnatural areas are preserved and public infrastructure and utilities are used as efficiently as \npossible. \n2. Neighborhood Design. Residents must have available to them within their neighborhoods, \nsafe and convenient access and movement to points of destination or collection. Modes of \ntravel to achieve this objective should be varied and should not conflict with each other or \nabutting land uses. Lots and blocks should provide desirable settings for the buildings that \nare to be constructed, make use of natural contours, protect views, and provide privacy of \nresidents and protection from adverse noise, lighting and vehicular traffic. Natural features \nand vegetation of the area should be preserved. Schools, parks, churches and other \ncommunity facilities should be planned as integral parts of neighborhoods. \n3. Community Connectivity. All portions of a tract being subdivided, unless otherwise \npermitted, shall be designed as lots, streets, planned open spaces, or other uses to avoid \ncreation of vacant landlocked spaces. The design of subdivisions shall provide for efficient \ntraffic flow, proper mixing of land uses, and a logical link between nearby existing \ndevelopments and the proposed subdivision. The City's Comprehensive Plan is to be used as \na guide in determining if the design of a proposed subdivision is proper. A plat may be \ndenied or required to be redesign, if, in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and any \nother adopted plans or policies, the proposed layout is not suitable for the site, or if the \ndevelopment of the subdivision would be premature. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-58. General Community Design \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n109 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n4. Environment. New developments should be designed to fit within the environment by ensuring \nthe following: \na. Subdivisions and land developments shall be designed to prevent excessive erosion by the \nforces of wind and/or water, and shall be laid out so as to avoid the necessity for excessive \ncut and fill. \nb. Whenever possible, developers shall preserve trees and other vegetation, waterways \nsuch as creeks and arroyos, viewsheds and scenic points, cultural and historic sites and \nresources, and other local assets and landmarks. \nc. Where feasible, conservation of energy through the use of solar and wind systems in \naccordance with federal guidelines is encouraged. \nd. Drainage areas, whenever possible, should be left in a natural state and no \nencroachments shall be made on the natural channel area. Drainage designs of \nsubdivisions shall be engineered using accepted best management practices, and so as \nto not increase historic drainage patterns or flows off site. \ne. Any land subject to flooding shall be platted in accordance with any applicable \nfloodplain ordinances, statutes and/or laws. The following should be indicated as a plat \nnote, where applicable: \"Homebuilders are required to provide a floodplain elevation \ncertificate prior to or with a building permit application. All plans and specs are required \nto meet FEMA guidelines for flood mitigation.\" Land subject to flooding or other hazards \nto life, health, or property, and land deemed to be unsuitable from the standpoint of \ngeology, soil conditions, or topography, shall not be platted for residential occupancy or \nother such purposes as may increase danger to health, life, or property, and shall not \naggravate erosion or flood hazard, unless such hazards are properly mitigated through \nthe subdivision planning process as provided in this Article. \nf. \nWhere a subdivision borders a railroad right-of-way or principal arterial street, design of \nthe subdivision shall include adequate provisions for the reduction of noise. \n5. Except as provided herein, all developments shall have frontage on and direct access to a \npublic right-of-way. In the interest of public safety and for the preservation of the traffic-\ncarrying capacity of the street system, the City Council shall have the right to restrict and \nregulate points of access to all property from the public street system. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-59. Lots and Blocks \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n110 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nSection 14-59. LOTS AND BLOCKS \nA. Intent. The intent of the block and lot standards is to continue Trinidad\u2019s existing block pattern in a \nmanner that is compatible with site-specific environmental conditions. \nB. General Provisions. In addition to the requirements established herein and any other applicable \nrequirements, all development shall comply with the following laws, ordinances and regulations: \n1. All applicable provisions of the Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S), as amended. \n2. The City of Trinidad Municipal Charter and Municipal Code, including but not limited to, the \nZoning Ordinance, adopted Building Codes, and with all adopted ordinances, regulations, \npolicies and other guidelines. \n3.

Lots. Lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall facilitate the placement of buildings with \nsufficient access, outdoor space, privacy and view. \n1. Dimension and Configuration. \na. Lots shall meet all applicable zoning requirements. \nb. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to provide appropriate setback \nfrom both streets. \nc. Lots should be designed, as far as possible, with side lines being at right angles or radial \nto any adjacent street right-of-way line. \nd. Except to accommodate drainage in easements, minimal grades shall be maintained \nalong lot lines. \ne. Double-frontage lots shall be prohibited in residential areas except where essential to \nprovide separation from principal arterial streets or from incompatible land uses. \nf. \nAll lots shall have vehicular access to a public or private street, as approved by City \nCouncil. \nD. Blocks. \n1. General Standards. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due \nregard to: \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-59. Lots and Blocks \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n111 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \na. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use \ncontemplated. \nb.

Dimension and Configuration. \na. Blocks should not exceed 1,320 feet in length unless topographical conditions or other \nphysical constraints justify a longer length. In general, blocks should not be less than 300 \nfeet in length. \nb. Blocks should not be designed so as to provide two (2) tiers of lots. \nc. Blocks may be irregular in shape, provided they are harmonious with the overall patter \nof blocks in a proposed subdivision. \nd. Blocks shall not be designed with dead end streets. \nE. Additional Area Regulations. The following additional area regulations shall apply to all zone \ndistricts: \n1. For the purpose of the side yard regulations, a two-family dwelling or a multiple dwelling \nshall be considered as one (1) building occupying one lot unless developed as a Planned Unit \nDevelopment. \n2. An open unenclosed porch or paved terrace may project into a front yard for a distance not \nexceeding ten feet (10'). An unenclosed vestibule containing not more than forty (40) square \nfeet may project into a front yard for a distance not to exceed four feet (4'). \n3. Open-lattice enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, and balconies opening upon \nfire towers, and the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues into the rear yard may be \npermitted for a distance of not more than three and one-half feet (3 \u00bd') and where the same \nare so placed as not to obstruct light and ventilation. \n4. Terraces, uncovered porches, platforms and ornamental features which do not extend more \nthan three feet (3') above the floor level of the ground story may project into a required \nyard provided these projections be at least two feet (2') from the adjacent side lot line. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n112 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nSection 14-60. STREET AND CONNECTIVITY STANDARDS \nA. Intent. The intent of the street and connectivity standards is to establish a safe, efficient, and \nattractive transportation system that promotes all modes of transportation and is sensitive to the \nenvironment. \nB. General Provisions. The street system of any proposed development shall be designed to create \nblocks that consider interconnectedness, topography, solar orientation, views, and consider the use \nby all modes of transportation that will use the system. Streets should be an inviting public space \nand an integral part of community design. Local streets shall provide for both intra- and inter-\nneighborhood connections to knit developments together, rather than forming barriers between \nthem. All streets should interconnect to help create a comprehensive network of public areas to \nserve all modes of transportation (including, but not limited to cars, trucks, buses, bicycles, \npedestrians, etc.). \n1. Street System Pattern. The street system pattern proposed in any development must \ncomply with the provisions of the Article and other applicable provisions of the City\u2019s Code \nof Ordinances, and shall: \na. Be designed to be logically related to topography so as to produce reasonable grades, \nsatisfactory drainage, suitable building sites, and provide for horizontal sight distances on all \ncurves depending on design speed. \nb. Provide for adequate vehicular access to all properties within the proposed subdivision \nplat boundaries. \nc. Provide adequate street connections to adjacent properties to ensure adequate traffic \ncirculation within the general area. \nd. Provide a local street system serving properties to be developed for residential purposes \nwhich discourages through traffic while maintaining sufficient access and traffic \nmovement for convenient circulation within the subdivision and access by fire, police \nand other emergency services. \ne. Provide a sufficient number of continuous streets and major thoroughfares, particularly \nin those areas designated for the development of high density multiple-family \nresidential, commercial and industrial land uses, to accommodate the increased traffic \ndemands generated by these land uses. \nf. \nWhen necessary to the neighborhood pattern, existing streets in adjoining areas shall be \ncontinued and shall be at least as wide as such existing streets in alignment therewith. \nWhen conditions permit, centerline offsets should be at least 125 feet. Greater \ncenterline offsets may be required by the City when necessary for traffic safety. Where a \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n113 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \nproposed subdivision is adjacent to or at the end of an existing street which will afford \nprimary or significant access to the proposed subdivision and is determined by the City \nEngineer, in accordance with traffic engineering principles and practice, to be of \ninadequate design or construction, the developer will be required to improve, \nreconstruct, widen or make any other alterations to the existing street as deemed \nnecessary by the City in order to provide appropriate and safe access to the subdivision. \ng. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the City may require the arrangement of \nstreets in the subdivision to make provision for the proper projection of streets into \nsuch unsubdivided areas. \nh. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practical giving due regard to \nterrain, topography, sight distances and safety. \n2. Cul-de-sacs, Dead-End Streets and Stub Streets. \na. Length of cul-de-sac. The length of all cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 500 feet, unless \ntopographic conditions warrant a longer length. \nb. Radius of cul-de-sac. The radius of the right-of-way for all cul-de-sacs shall not be less \nthan sixty (60) feet. \nc. Drainage of a cul-de-sac. Drainage of a cul-de-sac shall preferably be toward the open \nend. \nd. Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs, to permit future \nextensions into adjoining tracts or when designed as circular cul-de-sac turnarounds. \ne. Stub streets. Stub streets, greater in length than one (1) lot length, shall be paved to the \nfull width of the right-of-way for the last fifty (50) feet of their length. \n3. Street Connections. All streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets consistent \nwith the Transportation & Connectivity Plan of the Trinidad Comprehensive Plan. All streets shall \nbe designed to be logically related to topography so as to produce reasonable grades, \nsatisfactory drainage, suitable building sites, and provide for horizontal sight distances on all \ncurves depending on design speed. Street and transportation system shall provide more than \none direct connection to and between local destinations such as schools, trails, parks, historic \nand cultural resources, and Trinidad\u2019s nexus of Scenic Byways. Streets must provide connections \nwithin subdivisions and to adjoining properties to blend developments together and to disperse \ntraffic. \n4. Street Paving and Design. All streets shall be paved and shall be designed and constructed in \naccordance with City Engineering Design and Specifications Manual. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n114 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n5. Distribution of Local Street Traffic Street Network. All subdivision plats shall include a local street \nsystem that will allow access to and from the proposed subdivision, as well as access to all \nexisting and future adjacent development from at least two streets. A sufficient number of \ncontinuous streets and major thoroughfares shall be provided, particularly in those areas \ndesignated for the development of high density multiple-family residential, commercial and \nindustrial land uses, to accommodate the increased traffic demands generated by these land \nuses. \n6. Utilization and Provision of Local Street Connections To and From Adjacent Developments and \nVacant Parcels. All subdivisions shall incorporate and continue all streets stubbed to the \nboundary of the property by previously approved plats or existing development or as \ndetermined by the City Engineer. Existing streets in adjoining areas shall be continued and shall \nbe at least as wide as such existing streets in alignment therewith. When conditions permit, \ncenterline offsets should be at least 125 feet. Greater centerline offsets may be required by the \nCity when necessary for traffic safety. Where a proposed subdivision is adjacent to or at the end \nof an existing street which will afford primary or significant access to the proposed subdivision \nand is determined by the City Engineer, in accordance with traffic engineering principles and \npractice, to be of inadequate design or construction, the developer will be required to improve, \nreconstruct, widen or make any other alterations to the existing street as deemed necessary by \nthe City in order to provide appropriate and safe access to the subdivision at the developer\u2019s \nexpense. \n7. Street Intersections. Intersections of streets shall be as nearly at right angles as practical \ngiving due regard to terrain, topography, sight distance and safety. \n8. Street Layout. The street layout shall form an interconnected system of streets primarily in a \ngrid or modified pattern adapted to the topography, unique natural features, environmental \nconstraints, and open space areas. The street layout shall emphasize the location of \nneighborhood focus points, other internal open space areas, gateways, and vistas. The use \nof cul-de-sacs and other roadways with a single point of access shall be minimized. \n9. Buffering and Traffic Separation Requirements for Streets. Where a subdivision abuts or \ncontains an existing or proposed street, the City may require marginal access streets, \nreverse frontage with screening by landscaping and berming contained in a nonaccess \nreservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other \ntreatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to \nafford a separation of through and local traffic. If landscaping or berming is used as a buffer \nbetween the street and residential property uses, the subdivider shall provide a minimum \n20-foot landscape buffer in an easement or in a tract dedicated for such purposes along the \nstreet. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n115 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n10. Visibility at Intersections. No plantings, signs, berms, fences, walls, structures, or other \nmaterials or items greater than thirty (30) inches in height shall be planted, created or \nmaintained at street intersections within the sight distance triangle.  \n11. Access. Access to all subdivisions shall be from a public street system or an approved private \nstreet. Driveways shall not be permitted to have direct access to arterials or state highways \n(principal arterials). \n12. Right-of-Way Width. The width of the right-of-way to be dedicated for any designated street \nshall be in conformance with the City's Transportation & Connectivity Plan, and meet the \nminimum specifications of the Engineering Design and Specifications Manual or as \ndetermined and approved by the City Engineer. In those instances where the proposed \nsubdivision is located contiguous to an existing street having a right-of-way less than that \nrequired by the Engineering Design and Specifications Manual, sufficient additional right-of-\nway must be dedicated to bring the right-of-way width in conformance with the Engineering \nDesign and Specifications Manual. In all cases the minimum right-of-way width required for \nthe development of a designated street must be of sufficient width to accommodate the \napproved roadway pavement and drainage and utility facilities. \n13. Street Right-of-Way Dedication. The full width of right-of-way for all streets being platted \nmust be dedicated to the City. Partial or half streets may be dedicated, subject to the \nprovisions of this Section. \n14. Private Streets. Private streets may be permitted by the City Council if it determines that the \nuse of private streets will preserve the aesthetic environmental qualities of the subdivision \nwhile providing property owners with a safe, functional and lasting means of access. The \ndesign and approval of any private streets shall promote driver and pedestrian safety by \nimproving movement along streets and ingress and egress for properties adjacent thereto. \nGenerally, as the widths of streets and vehicular speeds increase, the number of private \nstreet connections thereto should decrease. \n15. Private Street Design. Private streets shall be designed in accordance with traffic engineering \nprinciples and practices as applied to existing and anticipated conditions, particularly the \nland uses to be served and the configuration of the street itself. Private streets shall meet all \nrequirements contained in this Article for public streets. Adequate space shall be provided in \nthe private street right-of-way for easements for the location and maintenance of utilities. A \nnote shall be included on the plat that provides that the maintenance of private streets shall \nbe the responsibility of the applicable homeowners' or property owners' association, and \nthat assessments for such maintenance shall be addressed in the association's deed \nrestrictions, protective covenants, or covenants, conditions and restrictions. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-60. Street and Connectivity Standards \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n116 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n16. Partial or Half Streets. Partial or half streets may be dedicated in those instances where the City \nconcurs that it is necessary for the proper development of the land and in the public interest to \nlocate a public street right-of-way. The City will not approve a partial or half street dedication \nwithin a subdivision dedicating less than a 60-foot right-of-way width. Appropriate notations \nmust be placed upon the plat restricting access from any partial or half streets so dedicated to \nadjacent acreage tracts until the adjacent property is subdivided in a recorded plat and the \nadditional adjacent right-of-way is acquired providing the full right-of-way as specified in this \nArticle. \n17. Perimeter Streets. When a street is dedicated which ends on the plat, the street right-of-way \nmust be dedicated to the boundary of the plat. \n18. Alleys. Alleys may be provided within a subdivision plat to provide secondary vehicular \naccess to lots which otherwise have their primary access from an adjacent street. Alleys may \nnot be used or designed to provide the principal access to any tract of land. \n19. Alley Right-of-Way Width, Intersections and Curves. Alleys must have a right-of-way width of \nat least sixteen (16) feet. Alleys must intersect with streets. \n20. Dead-End Alleys. No dead-end alley or cul-de-sac alley shall be permitted. \n21. Driveway Approaches. Driveway approaches shall be provided in accordance with the \ndriveway approach standards of the State of Colorado. \n22.  Driveways. Driveways shall be constructed with minimal grades or slopes. \n23. Street Lighting and Traffic Signals. \na. Street Lighting. The City shall install streetlights at the developer's expense. To minimize \nlight pollution, street lights shall only be installed at street intersections, street dead-ends, \nor in cul-de-sacs. \nb. Traffic Signs and Signals. Developers shall be required to provide and install all traffic \nsignage and signalization determined by the City to be necessary because of the \nconstruction of the subdivision. All signs and signals shall be provided and placed in \naccordance with City standards and shall be erected prior to the acceptance of streets \nby the City. Developers shall be responsible for upgrading existing signals, equipment, \nand facilities to accommodate their development. \n24. Fire Lane. Fire lanes shall be required where deemed necessary by the City to protect an \narea during the period of development and after development. If required after \ndevelopment, a fire lane easement shall be dedicated and marked as such in accordance \nwith applicable Fire Codes, so that it is to remain free of obstructions and provide access at \nall times. \nARTICLE 6. COMMUNITY DESIGN STANDARDS \nSection 14-61. Parking \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n117 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n \n25. Street Improvements Outside City Limits. In subdivisions located outside the City's corporate \nlimits but located within the City's Planning Area Boundary, street improvements shall \nconform to standards of improvements as outlined in this Article for subdivisions located \nwithin the corporate limits. \n26. Level of Service. All proposed subdivisions of greater than sixteen (16) residential dwelling \nunits or greater than 25,000 square feet of gross floor area for nonresidential subdivisions \nshall submit a traffic impact study with the associated development application. Such traffic \nimpact study shall demonstrate that the proposed development will not create traffic \nconditions that result in a reduction in the existing level of service (LOS) as outlined in the \nEngineering Design and Specifications Manual. \nSection 14-61. PARKING \nA. Intent and Purpose. The intent of these parking standards is to ensure that development \nimplements the goals and strategies articulated in the Comprehensive Plan for community growth \nand land use, and transportation and connectivity. The purpose of these parking standards is to: \n1. Provide for pedestrian connections and safety. \n2. Prevent the establishment of excessive amounts of off-street parking. \n3. Reduce the need for parking by promoting the use of transit, bicycles, and other alternative \nforms of transportation. \nB. General Provisions. \n1. Provision of parking spaces within an integrated parking and access system is required. \n2. The total number of parking spaces provided shall be the sum total of the individual parking \nstandards for each use. Mixed developments, shopping centers, and industrial or office \nparks, shall be evaluated on individual uses, however shared parking agreements, and the \nrelationship between specific uses shall be considered in determining parking standards. \n3. The minimum and maximum off-street vehicle and bicycle parking standards identified in \nTable 14-61 shall apply to all new development and redevelopment. \n4. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any \nfraction of one-half or less will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any \nfraction of more than one-half will be rounded up to the next higher whole number. \n5. Driveways shall not count as a parking space(s). \n6. On-site parking shall be maintained in good condition free of weeds, dust, trash and debris, \nand major surfacing defects. \nARTICLE 6.

PROTECTION OF FLOOD PLAINS \nSection 14-100. \nSTATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE \nAND OBJECTIVES \nA. Statutory Authorization. \nThe Legislature of the State of Colorado has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to \nadopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. \nTherefore, the City Council of Trinidad, Colorado does ordain as follows: \nB. Findings of Fact. \n1. The flood hazard areas of Trinidad are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of \nlife and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental \nservices, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment \nof tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. \n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special \nflood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, \ndamage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or \notherwise protected from damage also contribute to the flood loss. \nC. Statement of Purpose \nIt is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to \nminimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed: \n1. To protect human life and health; \n2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; \n3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally \nundertaken at the expense of the general public; \n4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions; \n5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, \ntelephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; \n6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas \nof special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; \nARTICLE 9. PROTECTION OF FLOOD PLAINS \nSection 14-101. Definitions \n \nTrinidad Land Use  Code \n187 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n7. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood \nhazard; and \n8. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for \ntheir actions. \nD. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses \nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for: \n1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to \nwater or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood \nheights or velocities; \n2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be \nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; \n3. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective \nbarriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; \n4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood \ndamage; and, \n5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood \nwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. \nSection 14-101. \nDEFINITIONS \nUnless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give \nthem the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable \napplication. \n100-Year Flood - A flood having a recurrence interval that has a one-percent chance of being equaled or \nexceeded during any given year (1-percent-annual-chance flood).

To ensure the structural integrity of WCFs, the owner of a WCF \nshall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local \nbuilding and safety codes. If upon inspection, the City concludes that a WCF fails to comply with \nsuch codes and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon written notice being \nprovided to the owner of the WCF, the owner shall have thirty (30) days from the date of notice \nto bring such WCF into compliance. Upon good cause shown by the owner, the City's Chief \nBuilding Official may extend such compliance period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the \ndate of said notice. If the owner fails to bring such WCF into compliance within said time period, \nthe City may remove such WCF at the owner's expense.  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n243 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \n5. Abandonment and Removal. If a WCF has not been in use for a period of three (3) months, the \nowner of the WCF shall notify the City of the non-use and shall indicate whether re-use is \nexpected within the ensuing three (3) months. Any WCF that is not operated for a continuous \nperiod of six (6) months shall be considered abandoned. The City Manager, in his or her sole \ndiscretion, may require an abandoned WCF to be removed. The owner of such WCF shall \nremove the same within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice form the City. If such WCF is \nnot removed within said thirty (30) days, the City may remove it at the owner's expense and any \napproved permits for the WCF shall be deemed to have expired.  \nD. Design Standards. The requirements set forth in this Section shall apply to the location and design \nof all WCFs governed by this Section as specified below; provided, however, that the City Manager \nmay waive these requirements it he or she determines that the goals of this Section are better \nserved thereby. To that end, WCFs shall be designed and located to minimize the impact on the \nsurrounding neighborhood and to maintain the character and appearance of the City, consistent \nwith other provisions of this Code. \n1. Camouflage/Concealment. All WCFs and any Transmission Equipment shall, to the extent \npossible, use camouflage design techniques including, but not limited to the use of materials, \ncolors, textures, screening, undergrounding, landscaping, or other design options that will blend \nthe WCF to the surrounding natural setting and built environment. Design, materials and colors \nof WCFs shall be compatible with the surrounding environment. Designs shall be compatible \nwith structures and vegetation on the same parcel and adjacent parcels. \na. Camouflage design may be of heightened importance where findings of particular sensitivity \nare made (e.g. proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views, and/or \ncommunity features). In such instances where WCFs are located in areas of high visibility, \nthey shall (where possible) be designed (e.g., placed underground, depressed, or located \nbehind earth berms) to minimize their profile.  \nb. The camouflage design may include the use of Alternative Tower Structures should the City \ndetermine that such design meets the intent of this Code and the community is better \nserved thereby.  \nc. All WCFs, such as antennas, vaults, equipment rooms, equipment enclosures, and tower \nstructures shall be constructed out of non-reflective materials (visible exterior surfaces \nonly).  \n2. Hazardous Materials. No hazardous materials shall be permitted in association with WCFs, \nexcept those necessary for the operations of the WCF and only in accordance with all applicable \nlaws governing such materials. \n3. Siting. \na. No portion of any WCF may extend beyond the property line.  \nb. Collocation. WCFs may be required to be designed and constructed to permit the facility to \naccommodate WCFs from at least two (2) wireless service providers on the same WCF \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n244 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nunless the City approves an alternative design. No WCF owner or operator shall unfairly \nexclude a competitor from using the same facility or location.  \nc. WCFs shall be sited in a location that does not reduce the parking for the other principal \nuses on the parcel below Code standards.  \n4. Lighting.  WCFs shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable \ngovernmental authority, or the WCF is mounted on a light pole or other similar structure \nprimarily used for lighting purposes. If lighting is required, the City may review the available \nlighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the \nsurrounding views. Lighting shall be shielded or directed to the greatest extent possible so as to \nminimize the amount of glare and light falling onto nearby properties, particularly residences. \n5. Landscape and Fencing Requirements. \na. WCFs shall be sited in a manner that does not reduce the landscaped areas for the other \nprincipal uses on the parcel, below Code standards.  \nb. WCFs shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of \nthe WCF from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of the front, \nside, and rear landscaped setback on the perimeter of the site.  \nc. In locations where the visual impact of the WCF would be minimal, the landscaping \nrequirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the City Manager or assigned \ndesignee.  \nd. Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the \nmaximum extent possible. In some cases, such as WCFs sited on large, wooded lots, natural \ngrowth around the site perimeter may be sufficient to buffer. \n6. Noise.  Noise generated on the site must not exceed the levels permitted in the City Code, \nexcept that a WCF owner or operator shall be permitted to exceed City Code noise standards for \na reasonable period of time during repairs, not to exceed two (2) hours without prior \nauthorization from the City Manager. \n7. Additional design requirements shall be applicable to the various types of WCFs as specified \nbelow: \na. Base Stations. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a Tower, such as a Base \nStation (including, but not limited to the antennas and accessory equipment) it shall be of a \nneutral, non-reflective color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the \nsupporting structure, or uses other camouflage/concealment design techniques so as to \nmake the antenna and related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible.  \nb. Alternative Tower Structures. Alternative Tower Structures shall be designed and \nconstructed to look like a building, facility, or structure typically found in the area.  \nc. Alternative Tower Structures located in the Right-of-Way. In addition to the other criteria \ncontained in this Section, an Alternative Tower Structure located in the Right-of-Way shall:  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n245 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \ni. \nWith respect to its pole-mounted components, be located on an existing utility pole \nserving another utility; or  \nii. \nBe camouflaged/concealed consistent with other existing natural or manmade features \nin the right-of-way near the location where the Alternative Tower Structure will be \nlocated; or  \niii. \nWith respect to its pole components, be located on a new utility pole where other utility \ndistribution lines are aerial, if there are no reasonable alternatives, and the Applicant is \nauthorized to construct the new utility poles; or  \niv. \nTo the extent reasonably feasible, be consistent with the size and shape of the pole-\nmounted equipment installed by communications companies on utility poles near the \nAlternative Tower Structure.  \nv. \nBe sized to minimize the negative aesthetic impacts to the right-of-way.  \nvi. \nBe designed such that antenna installations on traffic signal standards are placed in a \nmanner so that the size, appearance, and function of the signal will not be considerably \naltered.  \nvii. \nRequire that any ground mounted equipment shall be located in a manner necessary to \naddress both public safety and aesthetic concerns in the reasonable discretion of the \nCity Manager, and may, where appropriate, require a flush-to-grade underground \nequipment vault; and  \nviii. \nNot alter vehicular circulation or parking within the Right-of-Way or impede vehicular, \nbicycle, or pedestrian access or visibility along the right-of-way. The Alternative Tower \nStructure must comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act and every other local, \nstate, and federal law and regulations. No Alternative Tower Structure may be located \nor maintained in a manner that causes unreasonable interference. Unreasonable \ninterference means any use of the Right-of-Way that disrupts or interferes with its use \nby the City, the general public, or other person authorized to use or be present upon the \nright-of-way, when there exists an alternative that would result in less disruption or \ninterference. Unreasonable interference includes any use of the right-of-way that \ndisrupts vehicular or pedestrian traffic, any interference with public utilities, and any \nother activity that will present a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare.  \n8. Towers. \na. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, or, subject to any applicable FAA \nstandards, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness as determined by \nthe City;  \nb. Tower structures should use existing landforms, vegetation, and structures to aid in \nscreening the facility from view or blending in with the surrounding built and natural \nenvironment.  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n246 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nc. Monopole support structures shall taper from the base to the tip;  \nd. All Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing or wall at least six (6) feet in height and shall \nalso be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device.  \n9. Related Accessory Equipment. Accessory equipment for all WCFs shall meet the following \nrequirements: \na. All buildings, shelter, cabinets, and other accessory components shall be grouped as closely \nas technically possible;  \nb. The total footprint coverage area of the WCF's accessory equipment shall not exceed three \nhundred fifty (350) square feet;  \nc. No related accessory equipment or accessory structure shall exceed fifteen (15) feet in \nheight;  \nd. Accessory equipment, including but not limited to remote radio units, shall be located out of \nsight whenever possible by locating behind parapet walls or within equipment enclosures. \nWhere such alternate locations are not available, the accessory equipment shall be \ncamouflaged or concealed.  \nE. Review Procedures and Requirements. No new WCF shall be constructed and no collocation or \nmodification to any WCF may occur except after a written request from an Applicant, reviewed and \napproved by the City in accordance with this Chapter. All WCFs shall be reviewed pursuant to the \nfollowing procedures: \n1. Submittal Requirements. In addition to an application form, No Public Safety Interference \nLetter, and submittal fees, each Applicant shall submit a scaled site plan, photo simulation, \nscaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, \nsigned and sealed by appropriate qualified professionals, showing the location and dimension of \nall improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, \ntower height, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, drainage, and other \ninformation deemed by the City Manager to be necessary to assess compliance with this \nSection.  \n2. Inventory of Existing Sites. Each Applicant for a WCF shall provide to the City Manager a \nnarrative and map description of the Applicant's existing or then currently proposed WCFs \nwithin the City, and outside of the City within one (1) mile of its boundaries. In addition, the \nApplicant shall inform the City generally of the areas of the City in which it believes WCFs may \nneed to be located within the next three (3) years. The inventory list should identify the site \nname, site address, and a general description of the facility (i.e. \u2014 rooftop antennas and ground \nmounted equipment). This provision is not intended to be a requirement that the Applicant \nsubmit its business plan, proprietary information, or make commitments regarding locations of \nWCFs within the City. Rather, it is an attempt to provide a mechanism for the City and all \nApplicants for WCFs to share general information, assist in the City's comprehensive planning \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n247 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nprocess, and promote collocation by identifying areas in which WCFs might be appropriately \nconstructed for multiple users.  \nThe City Manager may share such information with other Applicants applying for administrative \napprovals or conditional permits under this Section or other organizations seeking to locate \nWCFs within the jurisdiction of the City, provided however, that the City Manager is not, by \nsharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or \nsuitable.  \n3. Applications for Base Stations, Alternative Tower Structures and Alternative Tower Structures \nwithin Right-of-Way, shall be reviewed by the City Manager for conformance to this Section and \nCode using the administrative Site Plan review process set forth in Section 14-30.C.  Should the \nCity Manager consider the proposed WCF to have a significant visual impact, (i.e. proximity to \nhistorical sites) or otherwise be incompatible with the structure or surrounding area, or not \nmeet the intent of these provisions, the City Manager may refer the application to City Council \nfor approval, after a recommendation by the Planning, Zoning, and Variance Commission. \n4. All other Towers may be permitted only as a Conditional Use by the Planning, Zoning, and \nVariance Commission.  All applications for Towers shall demonstrate that other alternative \ndesign options such as Base Stations or Alternative Tower Structures are not viable options as \ndetermined by the City. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no Towers \nlocated in the Right-of-Way shall exceed twenty-five (25) in height.  \n5. Additional Review Procedures for Collocations. \na. Application. The City shall prepare, and from time to time revise and make publicly \navailable, an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for the \nCity to consider whether an application for collocation is an Eligible Facilities Request. Such \ninformation may include, without limitation, whether the project:  \ni. \nWould result in a Substantial Change;  \nii. \nViolates a generally applicable law, regulations, or other rule reasonably related to \npublic health and safety.  \niii. \nThe application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case \nfor the proposed modification or collocation.  \nb. Type of Review. Upon receipt of an application for an Eligible Facilities Request pursuant to \nthis Section, the City Manager shall review such application to determine whether the \napplication so qualifies.  \nc. Timeframe for Review. Subject to the tolling provisions of subsection (5)d., within sixty (60) \ndays of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this \nSection, the City shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is \nnot covered by this subsection.  \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n248 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nd. Tolling of the Timeframe for Review. The sixty (60) day review period begins to run when \nthe application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement of the City and the \nApplicant, or in cases where the City Manager determines that the application is \nincomplete:  \ni. \nTo toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the City must provide written notice to the \nApplicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application, specifically delineating all \nmissing documents or information required in the application;  \nii. \nThe timeframe for review begins running again when the Applicant makes a \nsupplemental written submission in response to the City's notice of incompleteness; and  \niii. \nFollowing a supplemental submission, the City will notify the Applicant within ten (10) \ndays that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the \noriginal notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of \nsecond or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in subsection (5)d.i. \nIn the case of a second or subsequent notice of incompleteness, the City may not specify \nmissing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of \nincompleteness.   \ne. Failure to Act. In the event the City fails to act on a request seeking approval for an Eligible \nFacilities Request under this Section within the timeframe for review (accounting for any \ntolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant becomes effective when \nthe Applicant notifies the City in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for \nany tolling) that the application has been deemed granted.  \nf. Interaction with Telecommunications Act Section 332(c)(7). If the City determines that the \nApplicant's request is not an Eligible Facilities Request as delineated in this Chapter, the \npresumptively reasonable timeframe under Section 332(c)(7), as prescribed by the FCC's \nShot Clock order, will begin to run from the issuance of the City's decision that the \napplication is not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, the City \nmay request additional information from the Applicant to evaluate the application under \nSection 332(c)(7) reviews. \n6. Abandonment and Removal. Prior to approval, affidavits shall be required from the owner of \nthe property and from the Applicant acknowledging that each is responsible for the removal of a \nWCF that is abandoned or is unused for a period of six (6) months. \n7.

Standards for Small Cell Facilities and Network. \n1. Applicable Requirements. Small cell facilities and small cell networks, shall comply in all respects \nwith this Subsection G. in addition to the requirements of this Section applicable to all wireless \ntelecommunication services facilities, with the following exceptions, from which small cell \nfacilities and networks are exempt: \na. Setbacks;  \nb. Zoning;  \nc. Location; and  \nd. Any requirement or standard that an applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the City \nManager, operates to effectively prohibit or materially inhibit the provision of wireless \nservice within the City, in the context of the particular proposed application.  \n2. Zoning. Small cell facilities shall be permitted as uses by right in all zone districts, subject to the \nprocess and standards prescribed by this Section. \n3. Location. Small cell facilities are permitted in City rights-of-way, upon facilities in these rights-of-\nway and on public easements and facilities owned by the City under the following priority: \na. First, on an existing utility pole, (with the consent of the owner thereof), with attachment of \nthe small cell facilities in a configuration approved by the City.  \nb. Second, on an existing traffic signal pole or mast arm in a configuration approved by the \nCity, or in the case of a CDOT facility, by CDOT.  \nc. Third, on an existing freestanding or ground-mounted facility which meets the definition of \nand requirements for an alternative tower structure, for which all associated ground-based \nsupport equipment is concealed, in a location and configuration approved by the City.  \nd. Fourth, on a new freestanding or ground-mounted facility which meets all applicable \nrequirements and standards of this Section. \n4. Height. All small cell facilities shall not exceed two (2) feet above the light pole, traffic signal or \nother facility or structure to which they are attached, or, for such facilities located outside the \nright-of-way, the lesser of: (i) two (2) feet above the light pole, traffic signal or other facility or \nstructure to which they are attached; or (ii) the maximum height in the underlying zone district. \nARTICLE 14. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES \nSection 14-164. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities \n \nTrinidad Land Use Code \n253 | P a g e  \nJune, 2023 \nWhen new utility poles are proposed as an alternative tower, their height shall be similar to \nexisting utility/light poles in the vicinity.  \n5. Spacing. No small cell facility shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of any other such \nfacility or such lesser distance as proven by the applicant to be necessary to locate an \noperational small cell facility within the City, given all reasonably available location sites, existing \ntechnology and other small cell facilities in the vicinity, at the time of application.  \n6. Design Standards. The purpose and goals of these design standards are to:  \na. Ensure that the design, appearance, and other features of small cell facilities are compatible \nwith nearby land uses;  \nb. Manage the City's rights-of-way to ensure traffic safety and coordinate and accommodate \nvarious uses; and  \nc.

The permittee shall backfill the excavation in accordance with one of the two following\nmethodologies as set forth below:\n(a) METHOD A\n(I) \u00a0Backfill below the top two (2) feet shall be compacted to 90% of its maximum Modified Proctor density\n(ASTM D 1557). Backfill material shall be clean dry material free from muck, frozen lumps, vegetative matter or\nrubbish. All fill shall be placed in uniform and relatively level layers not to exceed eight inches prior to\ncompaction.\n(II) \u00a0The top two (2) feet shall be backfilled with well graded aggregate with a maximum size of one inch\nmaterial and shall be compacted to 95% of its maximum Modified Proctor density (ASTM D 1557). The fill shall\nbe placed and compacted at a moisture content within + 2% of its optimum moisture. All fill shall be placed in\nuniform and relatively level layers not to exceed eight inches prior to compaction.\n(III) \u00a0The City may perform compaction density tests on any excavation. \u00a0Any backfill not meeting the\ncompaction requirements will be removed by the permittee and recompacted as necessary to meet the\nrequirements.\n(b) METHOD B\n(I) \u00a0Backfilling shall be accomplished via the use of flowable fill. Flowable fill is a self-leveling flowable, lean\nconcrete mix which can be placed in one or more lifts with no tamping required. The 28 day compressive\nstrength shall be less than 60 psi to ensure the backfill can be easily re-excavated to facilitate future repairs, but\nshall be greater than 40 psi to ensure stability of the trench.\n(II) \u00a0The flowable fill mix design shall be as determined by the City of Trinidad Engineering Department based\nupon the availability of materials and shall consist of water, portland cement, fine and coarse aggregates.\nFlowable fill shall be mixed in accordance with ASTM Standard Specifications for Ready Mix Concrete. The\nflowable fill shall be thoroughly mixed prior to discharging to ensure a uniform product and shall be discharged\nas close as practical to its final location to reduce segregation. Use of a spud vibrator is recommended to\nimprove the consolidation of the flowable fill mix.\n(III) \u00a0Use of flowable fill eliminates the need for any compaction of the\nbackfill. The maximum layer thickness shall be four feet. Additional layers\nshall not be placed until the flowable fill can be walked on without indenting\nmore than two inches.\n(7) Pavement repair.\n(a) \u00a0On asphalt paved streets, the contractor shall place hot bituminous pavement to the depth of the existing street\nsurface or a minimum of three (3) inches, whichever is greater.\n(b) \u00a0On bricked streets, the contractor shall reconstruct the excavated portion of the street by means of the following\nprocedure: A two inch thick asphalt base shall be placed on the compacted subbase. This is covered with a one inch\nlayer of sand on which the bricks are laid tight. The top surface of the bricks is covered with sand which is broomed\ninto the cracks around the bricks. A small vibratory compactor is used to settle the sand down into the cracks to\nprovide a tight fit.\n(c) \u00a0Any excavations done during periods that hot bituminous pavement is not available shall be temporarily patched\nwith cold bituminous asphalt. Within a one-year period of time all temporary patches shall be made permanent by\nthe permittee. The warranty period will not begin until the permanent patch has been made.\n(d) If the applicant desires the City of Trinidad Street and Bridge Department to make the street patch, said applicant\nshall pay for the necessary repairs at the following rates: (Ord. 1585, eff., 5-2-98)\nAsphalt Patch - $40.00 per square yard\nBrick Patch - $85.00 per square yard\nConcrete Patch - The City of Trinidad is not capable of performing concrete patch work. \u00a0Any such work required and\nrequested of the City shall be contracted out and the applicant shall be assessed the City\u2019s cost plus 10%. (Ord. 1585,\neff., 5-2-98)\nTraffic Control - The applicant shall be charged a minimum of $50.00 for the setup and removal of traffic control\ndevices at each excavation patch location. \u00a0Major excavation patches will be assessed for the traffic control for the\nactual time and material costs incurred. (Ord. 1585, eff., 5-2-98)\nSection 17-32       Excavation permit; indemnification. (Ord. 1516, eff., 8/26/95)\nThe permittee shall indemnify and hold the City of Trinidad harmless and free from liability on account of any injury or\ndamage to persons or property resulting from or related to the permittee's exercise of any rights under an excavation\npermit from the City of Trinidad. Such duty of indemnification shall include, but shall not be limited to, the City's\nreasonable attorney's fees and costs in defending any claims brought against it as a result of the permittee's acts or\nomissions taken with respect to or as a result of an excavation permit issued by the City of Trinidad. In the event a claim is\nbrought either jointly or independently against the City as a result of acts or omissions of permittee covered under this\nduty of indemnification, the City, in its sole and conclusive discretion, may permit defense of it by permittee or the City\nmay separately defend, without limiting or reducing the permittee's duty of indemnification hereunder.\nSection 17-33.      Excavation permit; warranty. (Ord. 1516, eff. 8/26/95)\nAny patching, backfill compaction, or other work done as part of the excavation shall be warranted by the applicant against\nall defects for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the completion of such work. Any settlement of the surface within\nsuch twenty-four (24) month period shall be deemed conclusively to have resulted from improper construction techniques\nor defective compaction by the applicant. Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed to require the\napplicant to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the City of Trinidad Street and Bridge Department if such repairs\nshould prove to have been defective. If any repairs are required to the excavation area (due to improper construction\ntechniques or defective compaction) during the warranty period, the applicant shall be billed for said repairs if they are\nperformed by City forces.\nSections 17-34 and 17-35 - REPEALED (Ord. 1516, eff. 8/26/95)\nARTICLE 4.

the customer. \u00a0A Service Line provides service for the customer\u2019s exclusive use. \u00a0\n2.0 Meters, Meter Reading, and Billing   \n\u00a0 2.1 Metering of Service\n\u00a0The City will install, own, and maintain suitable metering and other equipment necessary for measuring the natural gas\nsupplied. \u00a0All service to a customer under one applicable rate will be measured by a single meter installation, and meter\nreadings of one meter installation shall not be combined with the meter readings of another meter installation for billing\npurposes.\n\u00a0Where service is supplied directly from a high-pressure transmission or distribution main, herein termed \u201cmain line\u201d, to a\ncustomer or group of customers, and the City does not own or maintain the piping beyond the main line metering point,\nthe customer or group of customers so supplied shall be responsible for and pay the City for all gas as measured on the\nmain line meter.\n\u00a0Standard delivery pressure of natural gas supplied by the City is four (4) ounces per square inch above average\natmospheric pressure. \u00a0Where necessary, the volume of gas as registered on the service meter may be adjusted to the\nforegoing condition for billing purposes.\n\u00a0Customer shall consult the City regarding the necessity of changing the location of gas service before building any addition\nor structure, and the customer shall not build over existing natural gas lines. \u00a0Customer shall not enclose any exposed\nportion of gas service facilities unless approved by the City. \u00a0Customer shall notify the City of any leak or defect observed in\nthe City\u2019s facilities. \u00a0\n\u00a0 2.2 Meter Reading and Bill Forms\n\u00a0Except as provided in paragraph Section IV.2.1, each service meter shall indicate clearly the cubic feet or other units of\nservice for which charge is made to the customer. \u00a0In cases where the dial reading of a meter (other than an orifice or other\nchart-type gas meter) must be multiplied by a constant to obtain the units consumed, the proper constant to be applied\nshall be clearly marked on the face or dial of the meter, if practical. \u00a0\n\u00a0 2.3 Billing\n\u00a0The Utility Service and Billing procedures set forth in Chapter 12, Article 1, of the Trinidad City Code, which are applicable\nto all utility services provided by\n\u00a0the City of Trinidad, Colorado, are hereby incorporated by this reference as if fully set forth herein. \u00a0\n3.0 Continuity of Service   \n\u00a0 3.1 City Responsibility \u2013 Non-liability\n\u00a0The City will endeavor to furnish and supply, but does not guarantee, uninterrupted natural gas service. \u00a0The City will not\nbe liable for interruptions due to maintenance functions considered necessary or to causes or contingencies beyond the\ncontrol of the City, including, but not limited to, accidents, breakdown of equipment, acts of God, floods, storms, fires,\nstrikes, riots, vandalism, war, or authority and orders of government, or for disconnection because of unsafe\napparatus(es), operation of equipment detrimental to other customers, non-payment of bills for service, or diversion of\nnatural gas. \u00a0The City shall also not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage occasioned by any interruptions arising from\nthe foregoing causes. \u00a0Such interruptions shall not relieve the customer of responsibility for payment for service under\napplicable contract or rate schedules. \u00a0\n\u00a0 3.2 Outage for Alterations\n\u00a0For the purposes of making repairs to or changes in the City\u2019s plant, equipment, transmission or distribution system, or\nother property, the City may, without incurring any liability therefore, suspend service for such period as may be required,\nbut will not inconvenience the customer unnecessarily. \u00a0The City will attempt to give reasonable notice to the customer\nprior to such suspension of service. \u00a0\n\u00a0 3.3 Outage Records\n\u00a0The City will keep a record of all interruptions of service upon its entire system or major divisions thereof, including a\nstatement of the time, duration, and cause of any such interruption. \u00a0\n\u00a0 3.4 Emergency Load Interruptions\n\u00a0In case of an emergency, the City shall have the right to grant preference to that service which, in its opinion, is most\nessential to the public safety and welfare. \u00a0The priority for emergency load interruptions shall be as follows: \u00a0\n\u00a0 A. Priority 1\n\u00a0Requirements of customers using natural gas for residential purposes, and service to:\n\u00a0(1) Schools, defined as a facility delivering instruction to regularly enrolled students in attendance at such facility;\n\u00a0(2) Hospitals, defined as a facility delivering medical care to patients who remain at the facility, including nursing and\nconvalescent homes; and\n\u00a0(3) Police, fire protection, correctional, and sanitation facilities. \u00a0\n\u00a0 B. Priority 2\n\u00a0Requirements of commercial customers having peak day requirements of more than 50 MCF and less than 450 MCF, and\ncommercial customers having peak day requirements of more than 450 MCF for plant protection purposes, provided the\ngas requirement for plant protection purposes is less than 450 MCF. \u00a0\n\u00a0 C. Priority 3\n\u00a0Requirements of commercial customers having peak day requirements of more than 450 MCF. \u00a0\n\u00a0 3.5 Curtailment Due to Gas Supply Shortages\n\u00a0In case of a shortage of supply, the City shall have the right to limit the availability of service under any sales rate\nschedule. \u00a0Such limitations will follow the priority order contained in Section IV.3.4. \u00a0\n4.0 Requested Alterations to City\u2019s Facilities   \n\u00a0 4.1 Requests by Customers\n\u00a0Requests for alterations to the City\u2019s facilities by the customers will be individually considered by the City and, if found to\nbe desirable or feasible, will be made. \u00a0If, in the opinion of the City, such alterations, or portions of alterations, are made\nfor the convenience of the customer and do not result in a substantial improvement to the City\u2019s system or to the service\nprovided, the customer will be required to pay the total cost of the alteration or portion of the alteration. \u00a0\n\u00a0 4.2 Request by Others\n\u00a0Other requests, such as for road changes, house moving, joint use, etc., shall be made sufficiently in advance to enable the\nCity to properly schedule the requested alteration. \u00a0The total cost of such alteration will be guaranteed by a cash deposit,\ncontract, or some other method agreeable to the City. \u00a0An exception to this rule will be alterations for road changes where\nthe City\u2019s facilities are located on public right-of-way and the governing body requires that the cost to alter the line will be\nthe City\u2019s cost. \u00a0\n\u00a0 4.3 Easements\n\u00a0By making application for natural gas service the applicant agrees to grant or arrange for an easement on applicant\u2019s\nproperty for the installation, operation, and maintenance of natural gas lines and other equipment of the City necessary to\nrender service to the applicant. \u00a0When requested by the City, the applicant shall, without expense to the City, make or\nprocure conveyance to the City of satisfactory right-of-way easements. \u00a0\n5.0 Customer Use and Facilities   \n\u00a0 5.1 Customer Installation\n\u00a0Concurrently with or prior to requesting gas service, the customer shall submit to the City, on forms supplied by the City,\nwritten data detailing the service requested, to enable the City to determine if the type of service, quantity, capacity, and\npressure desired by the customer is available; to determine if extensions of, or additions to, the City\u2019s facilities will be\nrequired; and to secure a definite location of the point of delivery. \u00a0Before any additions to or alterations of existing\ninstallations are made by the customer which will materially affect the amount of service required, or which may require a\nchange in the type of service or the point of delivery, the City must be notified reasonably in advance thereof as to the\nproposed additions or alterations in order that the City may first determine if the service desired is available and if\nfacilities may be arranged for and completed. \u00a0\n\u00a0 All gas piping and other natural gas equipment on the customer\u2019s side of the point of delivery will be furnished, installed,\nand maintained at all times by the customer in conformity with good practice and all applicable regulations, and will be\ninspected and approved by a City inspector, or by the state plumbing inspector, before a meter is installed. \u00a0However, the\nCity, by such inspection or\n\u00a0approval, accepts no responsibility or liability for injury or damage caused by defects in the customer\u2019s piping or\nequipment. \u00a0\n\u00a0 No equipment or apparatus will be connected to the City\u2019s distribution system the operation of which may cause such an\nabnormal pressure variation in said system to impair or endanger the natural gas service supplies to other customers of\nsaid system or to adversely affect operation of the City\u2019s metering or pressure regulating equipment. \u00a0In the event that\nequipment having a high instantaneous demand, such as a gas engine, is to be connected, the customer shall provide an\nadequate pulsation or surge tank, shut-off valves, and other protective devices as may be required by the City. \u00a0Customer\nshall, in every case, confer with the City before any equipment or apparatus requiring extremely close regulation or\npressure or quantity of gas is connected to the City\u2019s distribution system. \u00a0\n\u00a0 When the City is required, by order of properly constituted authorities, to move or alter its existing distribution system,\nthereby necessitating a change in the location of the service lead and the point of delivery, the City will designate a new\npoint of delivery to which the customer, at the customer\u2019s expense, will bring the service lead. \u00a0\n\u00a0 Service will be delivered to the customer for each premise at one point of delivery designated by the City. \u00a0For the mutual\nprotection of the customer and the City, only authorized employees of the City are permitted to make connections between\nthe City\u2019s gas service and the customer\u2019s gas piping. \u00a0\n\u00a0 The City reserves the right to require the customer to reimburse the City for any cost due to a change in meters or other\napparatus, or in their location, made at the request of the customer. \u00a0Meters and other equipment of the City will be\nremoved and relocated only by employees of the City. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.2 Protection of Sub-Surface Facilities\n\u00a0The customer shall consult the City regarding the necessity of changing the location of gas service before building any\naddition or structure. \u00a0The customer shall notify the City before operating or permitting the operation of any power\nexcavating or ditching equipment in the proximity of the City\u2019s underground gas service on the Customer\u2019s premises. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.3 Foreign Gas or Fuel \u2013 Emergency Fuel\n\u00a0The customer shall make exclusive use of service provided by the City, and no other source of gas or fuel shall be\nconnected to any installation, which in turn is connected to the City\u2019s gas distribution system. \u00a0This does not preclude the\nuse of emergency fuel systems owned by the customer, provided that switching arrangements are installed to prevent the\npossibility of the emergency fuel and the City gas service being connected to the load simultaneously. \u00a0The matter of\nconnection of any emergency fuel system must be approved by the City prior to use. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.4 Resale of Natural Gas\n\u00a0Natural gas service supplied by the City is for the exclusive use of the customer. \u00a0Consequently, the customer will not be\npermitted by submetering, prorating, or any other means, to determine a quantity of natural gas and resell the same as\nsuch to any other person or persons on the customer\u2019s premises or for use on any other premises. \u00a0The sale of energy by a\ncustomer, where natural gas purchased from the City is the fuel used for production of such energy for sale, shall be\nconstrued as a resale of the natural gas and is not permitted. \u00a0\n\u00a0The City reserves the right to refuse to furnish natural gas to any customer where the purchase of such service is for the\npurpose of resale by the customers to others. \u00a0In the event natural gas is resold in conflict herewith, the City shall have the\nright, at its option, either to discontinue service to the customer or to furnish service directly to the sub-customer. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.5 Access to Premises\n\u00a0The customer will provide access to the customer\u2019s premises at all reasonable times for authorized employees of the City\nfor any purpose incidental to the supplying of natural gas service. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.6 City Apparatus Remains City Property\n\u00a0All lines, apparatuses, instruments, meters, regulators and materials supplied by the City shall remain its property and\nshall be returned to it by the customer in the same condition as when received by customer except for ordinary wear\n\u00a0and depreciation, and the City may at any time examine, change, or repair its property on the premises of the customer\nand may remove all such property at any time after the termination of service. \u00a0The City\u2019s property shall not be worked\nupon or interfered with by the customer or other unauthorized persons. \u00a0All damages or injury to the lines, apparatuses, or\nmaterials of the City on the customer\u2019s premises caused by any act or neglect of the customer shall be repaired by City\npersonnel and paid for by the customer. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.7 Indemnity to City\n\u00a0The customer assumes all responsibility on customer\u2019s side of the point of delivery for service supplied or taken, as well as\nfor the natural gas installation and appliances used in connection therewith, and will indemnify, save harmless, and\ndefend the City against all claims, demands, costs, or expense for loss, damage, or injury to persons or property in any\nmanner directly or indirectly connected with or growing out of the distribution or use of natural gas service by the\ncustomer at or on the customer\u2019s side of the point of delivery. \u00a0\n6.0 Definition of a Cubic Foot of Gas   \n\u00a0 6.1 For Testing\n\u00a0For the purpose of testing natural gas, a cubic foot of gas shall be taken to be that amount of gas which occupies a volume\nof one cubic foot when saturated with water vapor and at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and under an absolute\npressure of 30 inches of mercury at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. \u00a0\n\u00a0 6.2 For Delivery\n\u00a0For the purpose of measurement of gas to a customer, a cubic foot of gas shall be taken to be the amount of gas which\noccupies a volume of one (1) cubic foot under the conditions existing in such customer\u2019s meter as and where installed;\nprovided, however, that when gas is metered at a pressure in excess of 4 ounces above average local atmospheric pressure,\na suitable correction factor shall be applied to provide for measurement of gas as if delivered and metered at a pressure of\n4 ounces above average local atmospheric pressure. \u00a0In cases where gas is supplied to the customer through an orifice or\nother type meter at other than standard low-pressure distribution conditions, the City shall apply suitable correction\nfactors or equipment as it deems necessary for measurement of gas as if metered at standard delivery pressure. \u00a0\n7.0 Meter Testing   \n\u00a0 7.1 Meter Accuracy and Testing\n\u00a0The City shall, at any time, have the authority to make a test of the accuracy of any gas service meter. \u00a0If the meter is\ndetermined to be inaccurate, the City may repair or replace the meter at its discretion. \u00a0\n\u00a0 7.2 Meter Testing on Request\n\u00a0The City shall, at any time when requested by a customer, make a test of the accuracy of any gas service meter free of\ncharge; provided, first, that such meter has not been tested within the twelve-month period prior to such request, and,\nsecond, that the customer will agree to accept the result of such test made by the City as the basis for settling any\ndifference claimed. \u00a0A written report giving the result of every such test shall be made to the customer who requested it,\nthe original record being kept on file at the office of the Trinidad Municipal Natural Gas Department for a period of at least\ntwo years. \u00a0If the meter is determined to be inaccurate, the City may repair or replace the meter at its discretion. \u00a0\n\u00a0 7.3 Records of Tests and of Meters\n\u00a0A \u201cmeter record card\u201d shall be maintained on each meter owned or used by the City. \u00a0Such records shall show the date of\npurchase, manufacturer\u2019s serial number, record of the present location, and date and results of the last test performed by\nthe City, which record shall be retained for the life of the meter.\n\u00a0Whenever a meter is tested either on request or upon complaint, the test record shall include the information necessary\nfor identifying the meter, the reason for making the test, the reading of the meter if removed from service, the result of the\ntest, together with all data taken at the time of the test in sufficiently complete form to permit the convenient checking of\nthe methods employed and the calculations made. \u00a0Such record shall be retained for a period of two years. \u00a0\n8.0 Gas Supply Charge   \n\u00a0 8.1 Applicability\n\u00a0All customers receiving service under the following rate schedules shall be billed a Gas Supply Charge: \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rate Schedule RS \u2013 Residential Sales Service\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rate Schedule CS \u2013 Commercial Sales Service\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Additionally, customers served under Rate Schedule SC may also be subject to the Gas Supply Charge if so provided in the\nspecial contract required to receive service under said rate schedule. \u00a0\n\u00a0 8.2 Purpose\n\u00a0The purpose of the Gas Supply Charge is to recover the cost of purchasing natural gas for the City\u2019s customers. \u00a0Such costs\ninclude the cost of upstream pipeline transportation, storage, and other services incurred to deliver the natural gas\nsupplies to the City\u2019s distribution system at the City\u2019s Receipt \u00a0Point. \u00a0\n\u00a0 8.3 Determination of Gas Supply Charge\n\u00a0The Gas Supply Charge shall be computed using the following formula: \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0A+B\u00a0\n\u00a0C \u00a0\n\u00a0 WHERE: \u00a0\nA= \u00a0\n\u00a0 Forecasted Gas Cost obtained by adding the forecasted cost of purchased gas and the forecasted cost of upstream\npipeline services. \u00a0\n\u00a0 B= \u00a0\n\u00a0 Deferred Gas Cost obtained by comparing the actual purchased gas cost plus the actual cost of purchased pipeline\nservices with the revenue recovered by the Gas Supply Charge. \u00a0If the Gas Supply Charge revenue exceeds costs, there\nshall be an over-recovery of gas costs. \u00a0If costs exceed the Gas Supply Charge revenue, there shall be an under-\nrecovery of gas costs. \u00a0\n\u00a0 C= \u00a0\n\u00a0 Forecasted Gas Sales obtained by normalizing an historical twelve-month period of gas sales volumes. \u00a0\n\u00a0 The Gas Supply Charge shall be calculated on an annual basis and changes to it will be effective on November 1 of each\nyear, unless otherwise approved by the City Council. \u00a0Additionally, the Gas Supply Charge may be calculated and changed\nfrom time to time during the year, if the change amounts to at least $0.01 per CCF or greater. \u00a0\n\u00a0 9.0 Extension Policy\n\u00a0The purpose of the Trinidad Municipal Natural Gas Department\u2019s extension policy for its natural gas distribution system\nis to: (1) set forth its service connection and distribution line extension requirements; (2) protect the City against making\nunwarranted or uneconomical investment which might adversely affect rates or service upon existing customers; and (3)\nprovide for the classification of natural gas distribution service to customers and the appropriate terms and conditions\nunder which service facilities will be extended. \u00a0\n\u00a0 9.1 Gas Service and Main Line
