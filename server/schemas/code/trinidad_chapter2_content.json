OTHER PERSONNEL REGULATIONS\nSection 2-70    Repealed (Ord. 3030, effective 1/14/22)\nARTICLE 17. CODE OF CONDUCT AND CODE OF ETHICS\nSection 2-71. Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics\n(1) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Introduction, Scope and Framework.\nThis code is implemented to help ensure the highest levels of civility, transparency, integrity and ethical behavior in the\nconduct of governmental affairs and decision making by Trinidad board and commissions, and Trinidad board and\ncommission members. \u00a0 This is done not only to maintain the highest level of ethical standards amongst Trinidad Board\nand Commission members, but also to instill confidence in the public at large as to the deliberative processes and decision\nmaking associated with Trinidad Municipal affairs. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThis code shall apply to municipal board and commission members, in their official capacity as such, in their individual\ndealings and affairs having to do with their serving as a board or commission member, and in their own individual affairs\nand dealings, insofar as those dealings impact or effect their serving or being able to serve honorably and ethically as a\nboard and/or a commission member. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(2) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Definitions.\nAs used in this Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct, the following words, terms and phrases shall have the following\nmeaning:\n(a) \u00a0Board or Commission: \u00a0means any appointive board, commission, committee or other appointed body\nestablished pursuant to State law, City ordinance, popular initiative, or a combination of any of the above. \u00a0This\nincludes City Council. \u00a0This shall include all City boards or commissions entrusted with or empowered to carry out or\nconduct the business of the City of Trinidad.\n(b) \u00a0Board or Commission Member: \u00a0a current voting or ex officio member, of an existing municipal board or\ncommission, including City Council. \u00a0\u00a0\n(c) \u00a0Board of Ethics: \u00a0the Board of Ethics shall be made up of the Mayor and the then sitting members of City Council,\nbut shall exist as the Board of Ethics after having been so convened. \u00a0The Board of Ethics shall conduct hearings,\nadvisements, reading of charges, and imposition of punitive sanctions pertaining to matters associated with the filing\nof an ethics complaint.\u00a0\n(d) \u00a0City Council: \u00a0the duly elected, then sitting and governing board for the City of Trinidad. \u00a0Members of the City\nCouncil, including the Mayor, shall comprise the Board of Ethics, and the Board of Ethics in this code may be used\ninterchangeably with the term Trinidad City Council as the ethics board and the board entrusted with enforcing and\ncarrying out the provisions of this code. \u00a0The sole distinction being that the Board of Ethics is the Trinidad City\nCouncil convened as the Board of Ethics. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(e) \u00a0Complaint in Ethics: \u00a0a complaint against the Mayor or a member of City Council, or a board or commission\nmember, alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct or the Ethics Code which shall, if not undertaken for the\npurposes of harassment, intimidation, or is not otherwise baseless or groundless, initiate a proceeding in ethics.\n(f) \u00a0Criminal conviction: \u00a0a judgment, jury verdict, guilty plea, or other adjudication or determination of guilt in a\ncourt of law, which shall include all U.S. and Colorado District and County Courts, as well as Trinidad Municipal\nCourt, or other Colorado municipal courts.\u00a0\n(g) \u00a0Petitioner: \u00a0the person filing a complaint in ethics.\n(h) \u00a0Respondent: \u00a0the person complained against in an ethics proceeding. \u00a0 \u00a0\n(3) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Advisory Opinions.\u00a0\nA member of City Council, or a board or commission member, or a board or commission collectively, may submit a request\nfor an advisory opinion per this Ethics Code, the Code of Conduct, or any other legal question or matter to the City\nAttorney. \u00a0Likewise, any board or commission member, or board or commission collectively, can always ask a policy\nquestion of the City Manager, the Assistant City Manager or the City Attorney. \u00a0It should be made clear that legal advice\ncan only be obtained from the City Attorney, but advice with respect to policy matters can and generally should be\nobtained from the other offices specified herein. \u00a0Advisory opinions with respect to legal or policy matters are encouraged,\nas it is far better to seek advice on such matters in advance of acting on a matter than to be wrong. \u00a0When seeking advice\nfrom the City Attorney, one should be mindful of the fact that legal advice cannot be given to a board or commission or a\nboard or commission member that would in any way be adverse, against, or detrimental to the City as a whole. \u00a0\u00a0\nAdvisory opinions from the City Attorney can and shall remain confidential provided that a request for an advisory opinion\ndoes not present a conflict with the City Attorney\u2019s role as the legal advisor for the City. \u00a0Further, if the City Attorney\ncannot assure confidentiality of a matter, the board or commission member may withdraw their request for an advisory\nopinion and have the matter remain confidential. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(4) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Initiating a Proceeding in Ethics: \u00a0The Complaint.\nAn ethics proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a verified complaint, filed only by a person with firsthand knowledge\nof the event or events complained of. \u00a0Said complaint must be predicated on conduct alleged to have arisen during the\npreceding 90-day period prior to the complaint having been filed. \u00a0A complaint in ethics must be based on an allegation of\na violation of one or more provisions of this code. \u00a0A verified complaint initiating an ethics proceeding shall be filed with\neither the office of the City Clerk or the City Attorney. \u00a0If the ethics complaint is filed with the City Clerk\u2019s Office, the City\nClerk shall provide the City Attorney with a copy of the complaint as soon as practicable. \u00a0The City Attorney will likewise\nprovide the City Clerk with a copy should the City Attorney be the one served. \u00a0City Council shall be notified within 72\nbusiness hours of the filing of a complaint in ethics against one or more of its members, but only after the Council person\nor persons complained against are first notified of the complaint having been filed against them.\u00a0\nThe board or commission member or members complained against shall thereafter be referred to in this Code as the\nRespondent(s).\n(A) \u00a0Review for Factual and/or Legal Sufficiency of the Complaint by the City Attorney:\nWhen a complaint has been filed against a member of City Council, or a member of a City board or commission, and prior\nto the complaint having been made public, the city attorney shall review the complaint for factual and/or legal sufficiency.\n\u00a0If it appears that the complaint is groundless, baseless, or undertaken for purposes of harassment, vindictiveness or other\nimproper purpose, the city attorney may elect to dismiss the complaint. The city attorney will only dismiss a complaint if it\nmeets the above criteria, and only after having notified the complaining party, the complained against board or\ncommission member, the board or commission that the member sits on, City Council, and after notifying the city clerk and\ncity manager of the existence of the complaint. \u00a0Further, a complaint shall not be dismissed by the city attorney if it is\noriginated by a City Council member, or a member of a City board or commission, so as to avoid allegations of the city\nattorney taking sides in a dispute between Council or \u00a0 commission members. \u00a0When dismissing a complaint, the city\nattorney will give the reasons for doing so, and provide the complaining party, the relevant board and commission\nmembers, City Council, and the City Clerk and City Manager a copy of the dismissal and the reasons therefore. \u00a0 \u00a0\nAfter the Respondent and City Council have been apprised of the filing of a complaint in ethics, the City Council shall, at its\nnext regularly scheduled meeting greater than seven working days after the complaint in ethics is filed, convene as the\nBoard of Ethics. \u00a0After the Board of Ethics has so convened, the Respondent shall be advised with respect to the complaint\nin ethics, and the complaint shall be formally presented to the Respondent and read by the presiding officer should the\nRespondent so desire. \u00a0The Respondent may waive reading of the complaint against him or her.\u00a0\nAfter the complaint is read or said reading of the complaint is waived, the Respondent shall admit or deny, in whole or in\npart, the allegations in the Complaint. \u00a0If the allegations are denied, in whole or in part, the matter shall be set for hearing,\noutside of thirty days from the date the complaint is first read and/or presented to the Respondent. \u00a0The Respondent may,\nhowever, waive said time period, and have the matter set earlier than thirty days, on a regularly schedule City Council\n\u00a0meeting date, should scheduling so permit and should the Respondent so request. \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(B) \u00a0Rights of the Respondent at a Hearing Upon an Ethics Complaint Having Been Filed:\n\u00a0Respondent shall have the following rights at the hearing on the complaint in ethics:\n(i) \u00a0that he/she has the right to a public hearing before the Board of Ethics, and to be presumed free from\nwrongdoing unless the complaint is proven by a preponderance of the evidence against them.\n(ii) \u00a0that he/she has the right to be represented by counsel.\n(iii) \u00a0that he/she has the right to confront and cross examine the witnesses called against him or her.\n(iv) \u00a0that he/she has the right to has the right to present evidence on their own behalf, including calling witnesses to\ntestify on their behalf, and to compel the attendance of witnesses to testify on their behalf.\n(v) \u00a0that he/she will have the right to a fair and impartial hearing on the ethics complaint, and that any members of\nthe Board of Ethics that may have a conflict of interest or are a material fact witness or a complaining party shall\nrecuse themselves from consideration of the ethics complaint at the hearing and from all other proceedings\nassociated with the Complaint proceedings.\n(C) \u00a0Conducting the Hearing:\nThe hearing will be presided over by the Mayor, or if the Mayor is a witness or a Respondent, the Mayor pro tem, or if the\nMayor pro tem must also be recused, next most senior presiding Council Member remaining on the Board of Ethics, that\nhasn\u2019t otherwise been disqualified or recused. \u00a0 This shall be per the rules of succession for presiding officers for City\nCouncil. \u00a0If there is a tie with respect to seniority amongst the remaining Council Members, the presiding officer shall be\ndetermined alphabetically, that is, the person whose last name begins with a letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\n\u00a0The presiding officer shall conduct the hearing, rule on objections, admit exhibits, and otherwise preside over the hearing\nand all matters that arise during the hearing. \u00a0The members of the Board of Ethics shall be allowed to ask questions of the\nwitnesses and the parties that give testimony.\u00a0\nThe Petitioner shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, in attempting to prove the Complaint\nagainst the Respondent. \u00a0The Petitioner shall proceed first in presenting his or her case in chief, consisting of testimony,\nexhibits and other relevant, admissible evidence, followed by the Respondent and his/her case in chief and evidence of the\nsame relevant nature. \u00a0The Petitioner shall be given a chance to rebut, with surrebutal being reserved for the Respondent.\u00a0\nThe Rules of Evidence shall be persuasive authority for the conduct of the hearing for the complaint in ethics.\n\u00a0\n(D) \u00a0Subordinate Boards and Commissions:\u00a0\nAs of the date this Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct are being written and considered for adoption, there are nine\nboards and commissions associated with the City of Trinidad, excluding the Trinidad City Council. \u00a0This Code of Conduct\nand Code of Ethics shall apply to all boards and commissions of the City of Trinidad, and shall apply to the individual\nmembers making up those boards and commissions as well. \u00a0City Council shall have sole jurisdiction and authority for\nenforcing this Code with respect to alleged violations of this Code made against members of subordinate City boards or\ncommissions.\nA complaint against a board or commission member shall be initiated in the same manner set forth in this Code, and\nmembers of a board or commission shall be afforded the same due process rights and protections provided herein, should\na complaint be filed against a board or commission member and not be dismissed by the City Attorney. \u00a0However, City\nCouncil, upon an affirmative vote by a majority of its sitting members, may summarily issue a letter of warning or\nreprimand against a board or commission member for a violation of this Code.\nShould the member of the board or commission that received the summary warning or reprimand issued against them\ndispute said warning or reprimand, that member shall be afforded the opportunity to be heard by City Council in response.\nMembers of boards or commissions should be mindful of the fact that they are participating in the business of the City,\nand as such, are representing the City in their capacity as a board or commission member. \u00a0Members of said boards or\ncommissions should refrain from untoward and excessive criticism of the City of Trinidad, City Council, City employees, or\nCity management. Members of subordinate City boards and commissions serve at the pleasure of City Council, and may be\nremoved from their position for cause by a majority vote of City Council. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nSection 2-71.1 Rules of Ethics.  \n(1) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Confidentiality.\nIt is of the utmost importance that board and commission members keep confidential matters confidential, and hold\ninviolate information that is entrusted to them as part of their official duties. While many matters will be entrusted to\nboard and commission members with the expectation and belief that the commission member will keep the matter\nconfidential, there are certain matters that are, and must be, kept confidential under all circumstances. \u00a0Such confidential\ninformation includes, but is not limited to:\n(a) \u00a0Executive Sessions: \u00a0it is required that all matters imparted or discussed during an executive session be kept\nconfidential. \u00a0This requirement applies to all participants/attendees of an executive session, but especially so for the\nboard and commission members present at the executive session. \u00a0Everything that is discussed, the viewpoints\nexpressed, or the leanings of individual members all must be kept confidential. \u00a0 This is especially so for legal advice\ngiven during executive sessions. \u00a0In such matters, the confidentiality considerations are heightened by\nattorney/client principles, as well as the requirements of the confidentiality of executive sessions. \u00a0 \u00a0 The content of\nsuch executive session shall be kept confidential unless it is decided by a majority of City Council to make the matter\npublic. \u00a0Board or commission members may lose insurance coverage for revealing matters that are discussed in\nexecutive session.\n(b) \u00a0Legal Advice Given Outside of Executive Session: a member of a board or commission may receive legal advice in\ntheir capacity as a municipal official in several ways. \u00a0Legal advice given publicly or during a meeting clearly does not\ncarry with it the need for confidentiality, nor can it be expected to be kept confidential. \u00a0A board or commission\nmember must differentiate, however, between legal advice given previously in a confidential session/discussion and\nwhat has been discussed or revealed publicly. \u00a0\n(c) \u00a0Quasi-Judicial Matters: \u00a0matters shared with board or commission members during, before, or after a quasi-\njudicial matter must absolutely remain confidential, so as to not jeopardize the integrity of the decision making\nprocess.\u00a0\n(d) \u00a0Other Confidential Matters: There will be other matters entrusted to board and commission members in their\nofficial capacities as well, where the board member will be asked, or expected, to keep a matter or matters\nconfidential. \u00a0Usually the person imparting the confidential information will declare the information confidential\nbefore the discussion regarding the information, but in some instances it should be a matter of common sense as to\ninformation that should be kept confidential. \u00a0\n(2) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lawful Compliance.\nBoard or commission members shall be expected and required to be law abiding during their tenure in office. Law abiding\nshall mean free of criminal convictions consisting of: \u00a0felonies, misdemeanors, class one traffic offenses, or criminal\nviolations of the Trinidad municipal code. Criminal convictions shall not be taken to mean convictions for traffic offenses,\nlower than a class one traffic offense. \u00a0 \u00a0A conviction of a crime under state statute, federal statute, or the Trinidad\nMunicipal Code or other municipal codes may result in the recommendation of the resignation of a member of City\nCouncil or a member of a subordinate board or commission, a vote of no confidence by a majority vote of City Council, or\nthe removal of a member of a subordinate board or commission by a majority vote of City Council.\nBoard or commission members must also abide by and adhere to the Trinidad Municipal Charter, and adhere to the\nrequirements and legal standards set forth therein. \u00a0Repeated violations of the Trinidad Municipal Charter by an\nindividual City Council or board or commission member shall be treated as a violation of any other portion of the Code of\nEthics or Code of Conduct. \u00a0If City Council, or a subordinate board or commission, shall inadvertently violate the Trinidad\nCity Charter, it shall not be deemed a violation by any individual member or all of the Council or a subordinate board or\ncommission. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(3) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Conflicts of Interest.\nBoard and commission members have a fiduciary responsibility to their constituents and to the people that transact\nbusiness and come before them to ensure that their decision making is independent, unbiased, and free from\ninappropriate outside influences. \u00a0Stated conversely, it is of paramount importance that board and commission members\nmake decisions in the best interests of Trinidad, and not themselves, their friends or family members. \u00a0Conflicts of interest\ncan and will arise for board and commission members in many ways. \u00a0It is vital to the decision making process that board\nand commission members exercise independent judgment free of conflicts of interest. \u00a0As always, if a board or commission\nmember believes he or she has a conflict of interest, the best course of action is to err on the side of disclosure in revealing\nthe potential or actual conflict, and seek the advice of staff, and the legal advice of the city attorney, in such a situation.\nThe standard that shall be adopted for purposes of this Code is that if there is a substantial appearance of impropriety, the\nappearance of self-dealing, or the likelihood of an impossibility or improbability of being able to exercise independent\njudgment, as determined by a reasonable person standard. \u00a0That is, would a reasonable person in the board or commission\nmember\u2019s position have their ability to fairly decide a matter compromised, impaired by, or would there be the appearance\nof impropriety, with respect to an outside matter that would make it less likely to render an impartial decision based\nentirely on the matter presented to the board or commission member? \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(a) \u00a0A direct conflict of interest: \u00a0\nA direct conflict of interest shall involve or deal with any decision a board or commission member would be required\nto make that would affect said member\u2019s business or financial interests; the business or financial interests of a\ncompetitor business; any matter that a board or commission member has a direct financial interest in; any matter\nthat would similarly benefit a board or commission member\u2019s family or family member, or their financial interests.\n\u00a0A direct conflict of interest reflects directly on one\u2019s ability to fairly judge or consider a matter, and shall always be\ndisqualifying for a board or commission member. \u00a0\u00a0\n(b) \u00a0An indirect or potential conflict of interest:\nThere will be times when a board or commission member will have a conflict of interest that is not a direct conflict,\nbut could or would rise to the level of a conflict of interest nonetheless. \u00a0The appearance of impropriety standard\nwould apply to such situations, and if it does appear that the board or commission member would have their ability\nto exercise independent and impartial judgment reasonably questioned, the member should move to recuse or\ndisqualify him or herself. \u00a0\nIf a board or commission member suspects that they may have a conflict of interest, the member should not take any\naction with respect to the matter until the question of the conflict of interest can be resolved. \u00a0A board or commission\nmember should raise or discuss the possibility of a conflict of interest as soon as they suspect that they may have a\nconflict. \u00a0Also, one should not attempt to influence one\u2019s fellow members of a board or commission, or members of\nsubordinate boards or commissions, on any matter within which they may have a conflict of interest. \u00a0This is\nespecially true of matters of a quasi- judicial nature.\u00a0\n(4) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Communications. \u00a0 \u00a0\nBoard or Commission members must not run afoul of the Colorado Open Meetings Law, and discuss city business with\nmore than one of their fellow board or commission members. \u00a0Communications between three board or commission\nmembers or more without a meeting having been properly noticed is a violation of the Colorado Open Meetings Law. \u00a0A\nboard or commission member shall not initiate, encourage, or participate in or continue a meeting that one knows or\nreasonably should have known is in violation of the Colorado Open Meetings Law. \u00a0This shall include communication by\nway of email or text messaging, as a group email or group text to two or more members of a board or commission would\nconstitute a meeting in contravention of the Colorado Open Meetings Law. \u00a0\n(5) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Nepotism.\nA board or commission member shall not attempt to benefit a family member by obtaining employment for them, having a\ncity contract awarded to a family member, or otherwise acting in one\u2019s official capacity to benefit, promote or elevate a\nfamily member. \u00a0These rules should apply to a board or commission member\u2019s close friends as well, and again, the\nappearance of impropriety standard should apply to this situation as well. \u00a0All rules with respect to conflicts of interest\napply to matters of nepotism, and it is a clear conflict and/or misuse of office to try to benefit or advance a family member\nin one\u2019s capacity as a board or commission member.\u00a0\nNepotism rules and considerations should be applied and construed strictly to personnel matters, and a board or\ncommission member should not try to interfere with or influence City management regarding the hiring/firing of a family\nmember or friend, or if already part of the City work force, their work performance, disciplinary matters, or any\ninvestigative or disciplinary matter undertaken by the City regarding that friend or family member.\n(6) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Emoluments/Gifts.\nA board or commission member should not accept a gift with more than $50.00 in value. \u00a0A board or commission member\nshould never accept services in lieu of or as a gift, if it relates to their being a board or commission member. \u00a0 \u00a0\nSection 2-71.2 Violations / Sanctions.\nIf a violation of this Ethics Code or the Code of Conduct is proven, the Ethics Board shall elect from the following options\nthe punitive sanction to be imposed:\n---to issue a public warning, verbal or written;\n---to issue a public reprimand or censure, verbal or written;\n---to issue a written public admonishment;\nA public warning shall be the least severe form of punishment, followed by a public reprimand/censure, with the most\nsevere form of punishment being a public admonishment.\nAs part of an adjudication of wrongdoing and the imposition of a punitive sanction being imposed per the above, the Board\nof Ethics may also recommend or strongly encourage the Respondent to attend remedial education or training given by an\norganization such as CIRSA or the Colorado Municipal League regarding the issues that gave rise to the complaint.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0In considering what punishment to impose, the Board of Ethics shall consider:\n---the severity of the misconduct;\n---whether the member has been the subject of an ethics proceeding before, \u00a0especially as it concerns the conduct\ncomplained of, and whether the present proceeding is of the same subject matter as prior ethics complaints/proceedings;\n---the facts giving rise to the complaint, the mitigation or aggravation of the alleged misconduct, and;\n---whether the Council or board or commission member is likely to repeat the conduct that gave rise to the complaint.\u00a0\nThe Ethics Board does not have the authority to remove a member of City Council, but does have that authority with a\nmember of a subordinate board or commission. \u00a0The Ethics Board shall not have the authority to levy a fine or impose\nother sanctions not specified by this Code. \u00a0 \u00a0\nSection 2-71.3 Code of Conduct.\nThis Code of Conduct is designed to set forth and memorialize tenants of good conduct for board and commission\nmembers, in facilitating how such members deal with and interact with each other, the public, and staff in their municipal\ncapacities. \u00a0This Code of Conduct should be used in conjunction with each individual board and commission member\u2019s\nsense of decency, respect, kindness to others and desire to pursue excellence in municipal affairs. \u00a0By getting along with\neach other, members of boards or commissions are better able to focus on the business at hand, rather than focusing on\nindividual personalities or issues with each other. \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nBoard and Commission members shall:\n(a) \u00a0While serving a term as an elected or appointed member of a Trinidad board or commission, be mindful that you\nare always representing the City of Trinidad, even when not conducting official business.\u00a0\n(b) \u00a0Be respectful of everyone and everyone\u2019s viewpoints, including your peers on your particular board or\ncommission. \u00a0Treat them as you yourself would and do want to be treated;\n(c) \u00a0Don\u2019t scold, admonish, belittle or diminish others in meetings, especially for taking a position you don\u2019t agree\nwith. \u00a0If you have a personal issue with one of your colleagues, address it respectfully after the meeting. \u00a0This applies\nto members of the public addressing or being involved in any proceeding with a board or commission;\n(d) \u00a0Similarly, don\u2019t scold, berate, belittle, admonish, or publicly criticize staff during meetings. \u00a0Should you have an\nissue with a staff member during a meeting, feel free to talk to them after the meeting, or direct criticisms about staff\nto the City Manager if necessary;\u00a0\n(e) \u00a0Outside of meetings, act in furtherance of the stated policies or decisions of the City in general and your board or\ncommission in particular, not in defiance of them. \u00a0Carry out the will of your particular board or commission if\nknown, not your own individual agenda;\u00a0\n(f) \u00a0 Honor and respect settled law and or policies of the City of Trinidad. \u00a0One can disagree with those laws and or\npolicies personally, but shouldn\u2019t criticize them or the policy makers for deciding what or how they decided; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(g) \u00a0 Adhere to the Trinidad Code of Ethics;\n(h) \u00a0Recognize the presiding officer and his or her authority while conducting the meeting; \u00a0\u00a0\n(i) \u00a0Remember that one of the most important reflections of a City, and a City\u2019s reputation, is how well meetings are\nconducted, especially that of City Council. \u00a0The better all of the constituent parts function, the better members get\nalong, the more that gets accomplished in an efficient, expeditious yet thorough manner, the better the City looks to\nthe outside world. \u00a0Respecting each other, the public and staff, being prepared, setting aside petty personal agendas,\nand focusing on the business at hand are all the hallmarks of a City board or commission to be proud of, and;.\n(j) \u00a0Recognize the presiding officer as such, and \u201cpoints of order\u201d and \u201cpoints of personal privilege\u201d notwithstanding,\nrespecting his or her authority while conducting the meeting. \u00a0 \u00a0One can always address a matter with the presiding\nofficer after the meeting, and express concerns or issues then. \u00a0The more a board or commission member maintains\ntheir composure and professionalism during something the individual board or commission member doesn\u2019t agree\nwith, the greater the likelihood of a rational result.\u00a0\nThis Code of Conduct, while setting forth standards of positive and favorable conduct, are primarily aspirational, and\ntherefore recommendations, rather that mandatory principles as set forth in the Code of Ethics. \u00a0However, repeated\nviolations of this Code of Conduct may, and shall be, enforceable as would an alleged violation of the Code of Ethics. \u00a0(Ord.\n2075, Sec 2-71 repealed and re-enacted, eff. 5-17-19)\nARTICLE 18.
