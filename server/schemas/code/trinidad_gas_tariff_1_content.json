the customer and do not result in a substantial improvement to the City\u2019s system or to the service\nprovided, the customer will be required to pay the total cost of the alteration or portion of the alteration. \u00a0\n\u00a0 4.2 Request by Others\n\u00a0Other requests, such as for road changes, house moving, joint use, etc., shall be made sufficiently in advance to enable the\nCity to properly schedule the requested alteration. \u00a0The total cost of such alteration will be guaranteed by a cash deposit,\ncontract, or some other method agreeable to the City. \u00a0An exception to this rule will be alterations for road changes where\nthe City\u2019s facilities are located on public right-of-way and the governing body requires that the cost to alter the line will be\nthe City\u2019s cost. \u00a0\n\u00a0 4.3 Easements\n\u00a0By making application for natural gas service the applicant agrees to grant or arrange for an easement on applicant\u2019s\nproperty for the installation, operation, and maintenance of natural gas lines and other equipment of the City necessary to\nrender service to the applicant. \u00a0When requested by the City, the applicant shall, without expense to the City, make or\nprocure conveyance to the City of satisfactory right-of-way easements. \u00a0\n5.0 Customer Use and Facilities   \n\u00a0 5.1 Customer Installation\n\u00a0Concurrently with or prior to requesting gas service, the customer shall submit to the City, on forms supplied by the City,\nwritten data detailing the service requested, to enable the City to determine if the type of service, quantity, capacity, and\npressure desired by the customer is available; to determine if extensions of, or additions to, the City\u2019s facilities will be\nrequired; and to secure a definite location of the point of delivery. \u00a0Before any additions to or alterations of existing\ninstallations are made by the customer which will materially affect the amount of service required, or which may require a\nchange in the type of service or the point of delivery, the City must be notified reasonably in advance thereof as to the\nproposed additions or alterations in order that the City may first determine if the service desired is available and if\nfacilities may be arranged for and completed. \u00a0\n\u00a0 All gas piping and other natural gas equipment on the customer\u2019s side of the point of delivery will be furnished, installed,\nand maintained at all times by the customer in conformity with good practice and all applicable regulations, and will be\ninspected and approved by a City inspector, or by the state plumbing inspector, before a meter is installed. \u00a0However, the\nCity, by such inspection or\n\u00a0approval, accepts no responsibility or liability for injury or damage caused by defects in the customer\u2019s piping or\nequipment. \u00a0\n\u00a0 No equipment or apparatus will be connected to the City\u2019s distribution system the operation of which may cause such an\nabnormal pressure variation in said system to impair or endanger the natural gas service supplies to other customers of\nsaid system or to adversely affect operation of the City\u2019s metering or pressure regulating equipment. \u00a0In the event that\nequipment having a high instantaneous demand, such as a gas engine, is to be connected, the customer shall provide an\nadequate pulsation or surge tank, shut-off valves, and other protective devices as may be required by the City. \u00a0Customer\nshall, in every case, confer with the City before any equipment or apparatus requiring extremely close regulation or\npressure or quantity of gas is connected to the City\u2019s distribution system. \u00a0\n\u00a0 When the City is required, by order of properly constituted authorities, to move or alter its existing distribution system,\nthereby necessitating a change in the location of the service lead and the point of delivery, the City will designate a new\npoint of delivery to which the customer, at the customer\u2019s expense, will bring the service lead. \u00a0\n\u00a0 Service will be delivered to the customer for each premise at one point of delivery designated by the City. \u00a0For the mutual\nprotection of the customer and the City, only authorized employees of the City are permitted to make connections between\nthe City\u2019s gas service and the customer\u2019s gas piping. \u00a0\n\u00a0 The City reserves the right to require the customer to reimburse the City for any cost due to a change in meters or other\napparatus, or in their location, made at the request of the customer. \u00a0Meters and other equipment of the City will be\nremoved and relocated only by employees of the City. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.2 Protection of Sub-Surface Facilities\n\u00a0The customer shall consult the City regarding the necessity of changing the location of gas service before building any\naddition or structure. \u00a0The customer shall notify the City before operating or permitting the operation of any power\nexcavating or ditching equipment in the proximity of the City\u2019s underground gas service on the Customer\u2019s premises. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.3 Foreign Gas or Fuel \u2013 Emergency Fuel\n\u00a0The customer shall make exclusive use of service provided by the City, and no other source of gas or fuel shall be\nconnected to any installation, which in turn is connected to the City\u2019s gas distribution system. \u00a0This does not preclude the\nuse of emergency fuel systems owned by the customer, provided that switching arrangements are installed to prevent the\npossibility of the emergency fuel and the City gas service being connected to the load simultaneously. \u00a0The matter of\nconnection of any emergency fuel system must be approved by the City prior to use. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.4 Resale of Natural Gas\n\u00a0Natural gas service supplied by the City is for the exclusive use of the customer. \u00a0Consequently, the customer will not be\npermitted by submetering, prorating, or any other means, to determine a quantity of natural gas and resell the same as\nsuch to any other person or persons on the customer\u2019s premises or for use on any other premises. \u00a0The sale of energy by a\ncustomer, where natural gas purchased from the City is the fuel used for production of such energy for sale, shall be\nconstrued as a resale of the natural gas and is not permitted. \u00a0\n\u00a0The City reserves the right to refuse to furnish natural gas to any customer where the purchase of such service is for the\npurpose of resale by the customers to others. \u00a0In the event natural gas is resold in conflict herewith, the City shall have the\nright, at its option, either to discontinue service to the customer or to furnish service directly to the sub-customer. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.5 Access to Premises\n\u00a0The customer will provide access to the customer\u2019s premises at all reasonable times for authorized employees of the City\nfor any purpose incidental to the supplying of natural gas service. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.6 City Apparatus Remains City Property\n\u00a0All lines, apparatuses, instruments, meters, regulators and materials supplied by the City shall remain its property and\nshall be returned to it by the customer in the same condition as when received by customer except for ordinary wear\n\u00a0and depreciation, and the City may at any time examine, change, or repair its property on the premises of the customer\nand may remove all such property at any time after the termination of service. \u00a0The City\u2019s property shall not be worked\nupon or interfered with by the customer or other unauthorized persons. \u00a0All damages or injury to the lines, apparatuses, or\nmaterials of the City on the customer\u2019s premises caused by any act or neglect of the customer shall be repaired by City\npersonnel and paid for by the customer. \u00a0\n\u00a0 5.7 Indemnity to City\n\u00a0The customer assumes all responsibility on customer\u2019s side of the point of delivery for service supplied or taken, as well as\nfor the natural gas installation and appliances used in connection therewith, and will indemnify, save harmless, and\ndefend the City against all claims, demands, costs, or expense for loss, damage, or injury to persons or property in any\nmanner directly or indirectly connected with or growing out of the distribution or use of natural gas service by the\ncustomer at or on the customer\u2019s side of the point of delivery. \u00a0\n6.0 Definition of a Cubic Foot of Gas   \n\u00a0 6.1 For Testing\n\u00a0For the purpose of testing natural gas, a cubic foot of gas shall be taken to be that amount of gas which occupies a volume\nof one cubic foot when saturated with water vapor and at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and under an absolute\npressure of 30 inches of mercury at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. \u00a0\n\u00a0 6.2 For Delivery\n\u00a0For the purpose of measurement of gas to a customer, a cubic foot of gas shall be taken to be the amount of gas which\noccupies a volume of one (1) cubic foot under the conditions existing in such customer\u2019s meter as and where installed;\nprovided, however, that when gas is metered at a pressure in excess of 4 ounces above average local atmospheric pressure,\na suitable correction factor shall be applied to provide for measurement of gas as if delivered and metered at a pressure of\n4 ounces above average local atmospheric pressure. \u00a0In cases where gas is supplied to the customer through an orifice or\nother type meter at other than standard low-pressure distribution conditions, the City shall apply suitable correction\nfactors or equipment as it deems necessary for measurement of gas as if metered at standard delivery pressure. \u00a0\n7.0 Meter Testing   \n\u00a0 7.1 Meter Accuracy and Testing\n\u00a0The City shall, at any time, have the authority to make a test of the accuracy of any gas service meter. \u00a0If the meter is\ndetermined to be inaccurate, the City may repair or replace the meter at its discretion. \u00a0\n\u00a0 7.2 Meter Testing on Request\n\u00a0The City shall, at any time when requested by a customer, make a test of the accuracy of any gas service meter free of\ncharge; provided, first, that such meter has not been tested within the twelve-month period prior to such request, and,\nsecond, that the customer will agree to accept the result of such test made by the City as the basis for settling any\ndifference claimed. \u00a0A written report giving the result of every such test shall be made to the customer who requested it,\nthe original record being kept on file at the office of the Trinidad Municipal Natural Gas Department for a period of at least\ntwo years. \u00a0If the meter is determined to be inaccurate, the City may repair or replace the meter at its discretion. \u00a0\n\u00a0 7.3 Records of Tests and of Meters\n\u00a0A \u201cmeter record card\u201d shall be maintained on each meter owned or used by the City. \u00a0Such records shall show the date of\npurchase, manufacturer\u2019s serial number, record of the present location, and date and results of the last test performed by\nthe City, which record shall be retained for the life of the meter.\n\u00a0Whenever a meter is tested either on request or upon complaint, the test record shall include the information necessary\nfor identifying the meter, the reason for making the test, the reading of the meter if removed from service, the result of the\ntest, together with all data taken at the time of the test in sufficiently complete form to permit the convenient checking of\nthe methods employed and the calculations made. \u00a0Such record shall be retained for a period of two years. \u00a0\n8.0 Gas Supply Charge   \n\u00a0 8.1 Applicability\n\u00a0All customers receiving service under the following rate schedules shall be billed a Gas Supply Charge: \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rate Schedule RS \u2013 Residential Sales Service\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rate Schedule CS \u2013 Commercial Sales Service\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Additionally, customers served under Rate Schedule SC may also be subject to the Gas Supply Charge if so provided in the\nspecial contract required to receive service under said rate schedule. \u00a0\n\u00a0 8.2 Purpose\n\u00a0The purpose of the Gas Supply Charge is to recover the cost of purchasing natural gas for the City\u2019s customers. \u00a0Such costs\ninclude the cost of upstream pipeline transportation, storage, and other services incurred to deliver the natural gas\nsupplies to the City\u2019s distribution system at the City\u2019s Receipt \u00a0Point. \u00a0\n\u00a0 8.3 Determination of Gas Supply Charge\n\u00a0The Gas Supply Charge shall be computed using the following formula: \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0A+B\u00a0\n\u00a0C \u00a0\n\u00a0 WHERE: \u00a0\nA= \u00a0\n\u00a0 Forecasted Gas Cost obtained by adding the forecasted cost of purchased gas and the forecasted cost of upstream\npipeline services. \u00a0\n\u00a0 B= \u00a0\n\u00a0 Deferred Gas Cost obtained by comparing the actual purchased gas cost plus the actual cost of purchased pipeline\nservices with the revenue recovered by the Gas Supply Charge. \u00a0If the Gas Supply Charge revenue exceeds costs, there\nshall be an over-recovery of gas costs. \u00a0If costs exceed the Gas Supply Charge revenue, there shall be an under-\nrecovery of gas costs. \u00a0\n\u00a0 C= \u00a0\n\u00a0 Forecasted Gas Sales obtained by normalizing an historical twelve-month period of gas sales volumes. \u00a0\n\u00a0 The Gas Supply Charge shall be calculated on an annual basis and changes to it will be effective on November 1 of each\nyear, unless otherwise approved by the City Council. \u00a0Additionally, the Gas Supply Charge may be calculated and changed\nfrom time to time during the year, if the change amounts to at least $0.01 per CCF or greater. \u00a0\n\u00a0 9.0 Extension Policy\n\u00a0The purpose of the Trinidad Municipal Natural Gas Department\u2019s extension policy for its natural gas distribution system\nis to: (1) set forth its service connection and distribution line extension requirements; (2) protect the City against making\nunwarranted or uneconomical investment which might adversely affect rates or service upon existing customers; and (3)\nprovide for the classification of natural gas distribution service to customers and the appropriate terms and conditions\nunder which service facilities will be extended. \u00a0\n\u00a0 9.1 Gas Service and Main Line
