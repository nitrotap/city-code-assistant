The permittee shall backfill the excavation in accordance with one of the two following\nmethodologies as set forth below:\n(a) METHOD A\n(I) \u00a0Backfill below the top two (2) feet shall be compacted to 90% of its maximum Modified Proctor density\n(ASTM D 1557). Backfill material shall be clean dry material free from muck, frozen lumps, vegetative matter or\nrubbish. All fill shall be placed in uniform and relatively level layers not to exceed eight inches prior to\ncompaction.\n(II) \u00a0The top two (2) feet shall be backfilled with well graded aggregate with a maximum size of one inch\nmaterial and shall be compacted to 95% of its maximum Modified Proctor density (ASTM D 1557). The fill shall\nbe placed and compacted at a moisture content within + 2% of its optimum moisture. All fill shall be placed in\nuniform and relatively level layers not to exceed eight inches prior to compaction.\n(III) \u00a0The City may perform compaction density tests on any excavation. \u00a0Any backfill not meeting the\ncompaction requirements will be removed by the permittee and recompacted as necessary to meet the\nrequirements.\n(b) METHOD B\n(I) \u00a0Backfilling shall be accomplished via the use of flowable fill. Flowable fill is a self-leveling flowable, lean\nconcrete mix which can be placed in one or more lifts with no tamping required. The 28 day compressive\nstrength shall be less than 60 psi to ensure the backfill can be easily re-excavated to facilitate future repairs, but\nshall be greater than 40 psi to ensure stability of the trench.\n(II) \u00a0The flowable fill mix design shall be as determined by the City of Trinidad Engineering Department based\nupon the availability of materials and shall consist of water, portland cement, fine and coarse aggregates.\nFlowable fill shall be mixed in accordance with ASTM Standard Specifications for Ready Mix Concrete. The\nflowable fill shall be thoroughly mixed prior to discharging to ensure a uniform product and shall be discharged\nas close as practical to its final location to reduce segregation. Use of a spud vibrator is recommended to\nimprove the consolidation of the flowable fill mix.\n(III) \u00a0Use of flowable fill eliminates the need for any compaction of the\nbackfill. The maximum layer thickness shall be four feet. Additional layers\nshall not be placed until the flowable fill can be walked on without indenting\nmore than two inches.\n(7) Pavement repair.\n(a) \u00a0On asphalt paved streets, the contractor shall place hot bituminous pavement to the depth of the existing street\nsurface or a minimum of three (3) inches, whichever is greater.\n(b) \u00a0On bricked streets, the contractor shall reconstruct the excavated portion of the street by means of the following\nprocedure: A two inch thick asphalt base shall be placed on the compacted subbase. This is covered with a one inch\nlayer of sand on which the bricks are laid tight. The top surface of the bricks is covered with sand which is broomed\ninto the cracks around the bricks. A small vibratory compactor is used to settle the sand down into the cracks to\nprovide a tight fit.\n(c) \u00a0Any excavations done during periods that hot bituminous pavement is not available shall be temporarily patched\nwith cold bituminous asphalt. Within a one-year period of time all temporary patches shall be made permanent by\nthe permittee. The warranty period will not begin until the permanent patch has been made.\n(d) If the applicant desires the City of Trinidad Street and Bridge Department to make the street patch, said applicant\nshall pay for the necessary repairs at the following rates: (Ord. 1585, eff., 5-2-98)\nAsphalt Patch - $40.00 per square yard\nBrick Patch - $85.00 per square yard\nConcrete Patch - The City of Trinidad is not capable of performing concrete patch work. \u00a0Any such work required and\nrequested of the City shall be contracted out and the applicant shall be assessed the City\u2019s cost plus 10%. (Ord. 1585,\neff., 5-2-98)\nTraffic Control - The applicant shall be charged a minimum of $50.00 for the setup and removal of traffic control\ndevices at each excavation patch location. \u00a0Major excavation patches will be assessed for the traffic control for the\nactual time and material costs incurred. (Ord. 1585, eff., 5-2-98)\nSection 17-32       Excavation permit; indemnification. (Ord. 1516, eff., 8/26/95)\nThe permittee shall indemnify and hold the City of Trinidad harmless and free from liability on account of any injury or\ndamage to persons or property resulting from or related to the permittee's exercise of any rights under an excavation\npermit from the City of Trinidad. Such duty of indemnification shall include, but shall not be limited to, the City's\nreasonable attorney's fees and costs in defending any claims brought against it as a result of the permittee's acts or\nomissions taken with respect to or as a result of an excavation permit issued by the City of Trinidad. In the event a claim is\nbrought either jointly or independently against the City as a result of acts or omissions of permittee covered under this\nduty of indemnification, the City, in its sole and conclusive discretion, may permit defense of it by permittee or the City\nmay separately defend, without limiting or reducing the permittee's duty of indemnification hereunder.\nSection 17-33.      Excavation permit; warranty. (Ord. 1516, eff. 8/26/95)\nAny patching, backfill compaction, or other work done as part of the excavation shall be warranted by the applicant against\nall defects for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the completion of such work. Any settlement of the surface within\nsuch twenty-four (24) month period shall be deemed conclusively to have resulted from improper construction techniques\nor defective compaction by the applicant. Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed to require the\napplicant to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the City of Trinidad Street and Bridge Department if such repairs\nshould prove to have been defective. If any repairs are required to the excavation area (due to improper construction\ntechniques or defective compaction) during the warranty period, the applicant shall be billed for said repairs if they are\nperformed by City forces.\nSections 17-34 and 17-35 - REPEALED (Ord. 1516, eff. 8/26/95)\nARTICLE 4.
